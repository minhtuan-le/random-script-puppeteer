Well, this novel recently got a manga adaptation, which is currently on chapter 1, and I liked it, so here it is. The manga it’s a direct adaptation of the web novel; I understand it doesn’t have a light novel.
01 The Childhood Friend Wants to Become a Mob Character
I stood at my desk in the classroom.
“Suzuna, I guess I could walk home with you again today?”
A black-haired boy looked down at me.
…Strange.
I’d never seen this classroom before, and I’d never spoken to this boy.
Even so, I knew.
This was Seiran Academy, and the boy’s name was Shindo Minato.
Somehow, I knew it well.
As I tried to figure out why, it immediately hit me.
“…Ah, this is the world of that game I was playing last. This is it.”
“My Girlfriend Next Door is Super Sweet”
Commonly known as: KanoAma
…I think.
Anyway, I was playing a dating sim with that title.
This world is strikingly similar to that game.
Could it be… this is what they call reincarnation?
“Huh, game…? What are you talking about all of a sudden?”
“Ah, um, it’s nothing. More importantly, Shindo…-kun. What did you just call me?”
“Huh? Don’t ask weird questions… Suzuna is Suzuna, right? What else would I call you?”
Ah… Seriously?
The name of the girl he called was Amatsuki Suzuna.
One of the heroines, her position: childhood friend.
It seems I’ve been reborn as one of these characters.
“See, you don’t have anyone to go home with anyway, right? I’ll walk home with you.”
Shindo Minato and his childhood friend, Amatsuki Suzuna, always went to and from school together.
However, as you can see, Minato’s attitude towards Suzuna is noticeably arrogant.
Even now, he’s giving off this “I’m doing you a favor” aura.
But Suzuna is incredibly kind.
She’s harbored feelings for Shindo Minato since childhood, keeping them hidden while remaining his friend.
That’s why, even when treated like this, she responds with a smile. Such a pure-hearted girl.
If I were to respond like her, going home with him would be the right answer.
…But.
“I’m going home alone, it’s fine.”
I told him my intentions clearly, in a voice that even I thought sounded blunt.
◇◇◇
Even though it was an unfamiliar hallway, I knew the way like the back of my hand, like it was my own home.
As Amatsuki Suzuna, I share her memories of this world.
I headed straight for the entrance.
“H-Hey… Suzuna, what’s wrong? Are you… mad at me or something…?”
But there was a boy following behind me.
“I’m not mad.”
“Th-Then… why aren’t you walking home with me? We always do.”
“Just because we always do, doesn’t mean we have to today.”
More than anything, I wanted him to stop following me.
Being approached by boys is a little scary.
“Did I… do something to you, Suzuna?”
“…Do you have any idea what it might be?”
“Uh… ah, no, like today, you let me copy your homework, and you woke me up right before class when I was sleeping, and you swapped cleaning duty with me… or something?”
Yes, this boy is incredibly lazy. And dependent on girls for everything.
The heroines of this world constantly pamper the protagonist. As if there’s some rule that they can only fall for good-for-nothing guys.
Even though he’s a second-year high school student, they only spoil him and never scold him.
And among them, this heroine, Amatsuki Suzuna, is especially sweet.
Just because they’re childhood friends, she’s always taken care of him since they were young.
She’s constantly subservient, always watching his expression, and always treats him kindly.
Honestly, as the player, I couldn’t understand it.
I didn’t like this protagonist, and I didn’t understand Suzuna’s feelings for him either.
I couldn’t empathize with her at all.
“It might be that.”
“Eh, even so, why all of a sudden…?”
“Anyway, I’m going home alone. Bye-bye, Shindo-kun.”
That’s why, I won’t be captured.
Even if this is the world of a dating sim, I refuse to date a boy I don’t like.
“…He finally gave up.”
Looking back after passing the school gates, Shindo-kun was nowhere to be seen.
“But… did I say too much?”
The image of Shindo-kun falling silent with a hurt expression after my parting words wouldn’t leave my mind.
I had to be clear so he’d understand, but I didn’t want to hurt him needlessly.
I just didn’t want to end up in the troublesome position of being his girlfriend.
“Seriously, even in a game world, I can’t get along with people… Give me a break…”
I sighed a little, remembering the world I came from.
No matter where I am, can I never live the way I want?
“Stop it, stop it. This is a new life, I have to enjoy it.”
Yes, it shouldn’t all be doom and gloom.
By walking this new life, I might gain something different.
Fortunately, Amatsuki Suzuna wasn’t a character that others disliked.
If I play my cards right, I might even be able to have a decent school life.
A heroine who isn’t captured by the protagonist, no, better yet, become a mob character and live a modest school life.
A peaceful life suits me.
Somehow, deciding on a future course of action calmed my mind.
My footsteps became a little lighter, and I hurried home.
I passed through the downtown area.
I’m not very fond of this space, where the buildings suddenly become larger and the crowds increase.
I quickened my pace to get through it quickly.
“I’m teeellling you, I’m not interested!”
…Hm?
A girl’s voice I’d heard somewhere reached my ears.
Looking towards the source of the voice, I saw a girl with light brown, loosely curled hair and heavy makeup, wearing a cheap-looking suit, being harassed by a man.
“You’re cute, so… I think you could easily earn money, even if it’s just for 1 or 2 hours a day.”
“Huh? What’s that? Super sketchy, it’s creepy. I’m not struggling for money, anyway.”
The girl was wearing the same uniform as me.
Hers was quite disheveled, giving off a rather frivolous impression, but she was definitely a student at the same school.
“Lies, dressed like that, there’s no way you’re not interested. It’s not sketchy at all, so just listen to what I have to say, and you can refuse if you don’t like it.”
“I’m already refusing. Seriously, you’re persistent.”
…Ah….
I racked my brain at the sight.
I remember this event.
Originally, Amatsuki Suzuna should have been going home with Shindo Minato today.
Shindo-kun, as usual, would have been boasting to Suzuna.
‘I’d do anything for a cute girl.’
He’d say something superficial like that.
But, because Suzuna is a naive girl…
‘Is that so? Then if there’s a girl in trouble, I can ask you for help, Minato-kun.’
She’d give a carefree reply like that.
And then they’d encounter this scene.
‘Hey Minato-kun, that girl looks like she’s in trouble.’
‘…Yeah.’
‘You said you’d do anything for a girl, right?’
‘……Yeah.’
Unable to back down from his careless words, Shindo Minato would half-heartedly charge at the man in the suit.
The man, thinking he was outnumbered, would retreat…
“Because of me, Shindo-kun isn’t here…”
In other words, the protagonist who was supposed to save her is absent.
The guilt weighed even heavier on me.
I couldn’t just ignore this…
Suppressing the fear welling up in my chest, I quickened my pace.
“Hey, hey, come on. Just a little, just a tiny bit.”
“No, don’t touch me. Seriously, you’re gross.”
The man’s advances were finally becoming forceful, and even I, watching, felt anxious.
I broke into a run, and then…
“Ah, ahhh. Sorry, sorry, were you waiting?”
I forced myself between the two of them and called out.
My voice cracked a little, unused to such lines.
“Uh, um…?”
A classmate she hadn’t made plans with suddenly called out to her.
Of course she’d be taken aback.
“Shopping first? Come on, we don’t have time, let’s go.”
Ignoring her bewilderment, I took the flashy girl’s hand and started walking.
“Hey, wait a minute!”
To the man in the suit who was still trying to pursue us, I opened my mouth.
“Sir, this girl and I have something to do. Besides, if you keep pestering her, I’ll call the police. You’re targeting a minor, and if rumors spread, it could affect your job, you know? Is that okay with you?”
“…Tch, whatever, fine.”
The man clearly looked displeased as he backed down.
Well, at least he wouldn’t bother her any further.
“Let’s go, Hinase-san.”
“Ah, y-yeah!”
I then took her hand—the hand of one of the heroines, Hinase Riri—and left the downtown area behind.
------------------ 
02 Entangled with the Gal Heroine
“Wait a minute. This is a bit much, don’t you think?”
I took Hinase Riri’s hand and hurried away from the downtown area.
Driven by the fear that the man might chase after us, I ran without stopping.
As a result, we’d covered quite a distance before I realized it.
“S-Sorry…. You must be tired.”
“No, I’m totally fine. Actually, I’m grateful.”
Hinase-san certainly didn’t look tired.
Rather, I was the one out of breath.
Even after being reborn, my introverted clumsiness remains…
“You’re Amatsuki-san, right…?”
Hinase-san looked at me, half-doubtful as she spoke my name.
It was the spring of our second year, and we’d only just become classmates.
It couldn’t be helped if she wasn’t sure.
“Yes, Amatsuki Suzuna…”
I introduced myself for now.
Hinase Riri is the flashy girl at the top of the class hierarchy. You could even label her as a “gyaru” and a social butterfly.
In contrast, Amatsuki Suzuna is the introverted girl at the very bottom.
Normally, we’d never interact.
Even though there were opportunities to talk in the game, centered around the protagonist, Shindo Minato…
“Thanks, Amatsuki-san. That guy was being really persistent, it was getting annoying.”
Hinase-san smiled brightly, without a care in the world.
…I never thought I would be the one approaching her like this.
“Ah… yeah, seeing your expression, Hinase-san, I kind of got the feeling you were in trouble.”
“Oh, you know my name?”
“Of course. We’re classmates, and you’re famous, Hinase-san.”
Large, round eyes, loosely curled brown hair.
Her blazer was open, and the buttons of her blouse were undone, revealing a hint of her cleavage.
Her skirt was short, and her legs were quite exposed.
Slender, but not too thin, a healthy physique.
She was the most popular girl at Seiran Academy, someone who caught everyone’s eye.
…That was the setting, anyway.
Well, even without that prior knowledge, anyone could see at a glance that she was popular.
“A-Ahaha… I do stand out, don’t I? There are probably some unsavory rumors about me.”
“It’s not like that…”
And Hinase Riri is also a girl oblivious to her own popularity.
With her outstanding looks and feminine attire, she wasn’t haughty.
Rather, she had a very casual personality.
Of course she’d be popular. Even I, her complete opposite, could understand that.
“It’s fine, it’s fine. I tend to be underestimated. That guy probably approached me because he saw me that way.”
Is it just my bad personality that makes that sound like a roundabout way of bragging…?
Well, even I, as a girl, think Hinase-san is beautiful. So it’s probably unavoidable that men would hit on her.
I looked at my reflection in a nearby window.
An unremarkable, dull face, thick black-rimmed glasses.
My black hair was in pigtails, my uniform buttoned all the way up, and my skirt length strictly adhered to the school rules.
The picture-perfect image of an introverted girl.
Well, it is literally a picture-perfect world, so I guess it’s natural…
Anyway, Amatsuki Suzuna is plain.
That’s to be expected. While this character exists as a heroine, when you get down to it, her role was mostly to mediate and move the story along.
Her ending was also a bit ambiguous, with the relationship with the protagonist not progressing beyond that of childhood friends…
Well, whatever.
My previous self was also plain and inconspicuous like Amatsuki Suzuna, so it doesn’t feel that strange.
Rather, it’s so true to life that I almost feel a slight sense of self-loathing.
But if you were to ask me if I wanted to be the polar opposite, like Hinase-san in front of me…
No way.
I couldn’t maintain that level of femininity for even a day.
“Amatsuki-san, you’re pretty gutsy.”
“Eh, ehh…?”
Isn’t “gutsy” a bit of an overstatement…?
I mean, I’m aware that I lack femininity, but…
“Everyone on the street just pretended not to see me when I was in trouble. It’s fine since I wasn’t asking for help, but it was surprising that you, Amatsuki-san, were the first to speak up.”
Ah, so that’s what she meant.
Originally, this was the scene where the protagonist would save her.
I guess it could be considered gutsy. It was originally an action a boy would have taken.
“I’m glad I could help. Well then, I’ll be…”
There was nothing more to talk about between us, with our different personalities.
I should retreat before an awkward silence falls.
“Eh, wait!”
However, Hinase-san grabbed my arm.
My movement was restricted.
“Um… is something the matter?”
“Let me thank you.”
…A bad feeling.
“I didn’t do anything that warrants thanks.”
“No way, I can’t just let a classmate help me and go home without saying anything.”
Hmm…
I’ve seen this exact same scenario play out before.
These are the lines she’d use to invite Shindo Minato, who should be here…
What am I supposed to do, receiving them instead?
“Amatsuki-san, do you like sweets?”
“…I hate them.”
I actually like them.
But if I accept, we’ll end up going to get sweets… so I have to refuse.
“Ah, is that so. …It’s after school, aren’t you a little hungry?”
“I’m not hungry.”
Hinase-san is desperately trying to treat me to something…
I don’t need it, I don’t need it.
You don’t have to raise any flags with me. Please do that with Shindo-kun.
“…Not even a little?”
“I’m actually pretty full.”
“…Wow.”
“Yeah, I get full easily.”
“Too easily.”
Hinase-san seems slightly taken aback…
Well, a girl saying she’s full in the evening after school is certainly strange.
Of course, it’s a lie, and I’m actually getting hungry.
“Ah, then you must be thirsty, right? We ran quite a bit, and you were out of breath, Amatsuki-san.”
Hinase-san’s eyes lit up as if she’d had a brilliant idea.
She’s probably thinking of taking me to a cafe.
But that’s no good either.
“I’m not thirsty.”
“…Seriously?”
“Seriously.”
“Even after running that much?”
“I’m the type who doesn’t get thirsty even after exercising.”
“…Do such people exist?”
“Right here.”
“Amatsuki-san, you’re not in any sports clubs, are you?”
“…I’m in the going-home club.”
Hinase-san’s gaze pierced me.
“Amatsuki-san, are you rejecting me?”
“…”
The way she asks such a delicate question without sugarcoating it… it’s so… “social butterfly” of her.
I couldn’t ask something so scary.
Even a polite reply would make me feel awkward, and if she told me the truth, I’d just get hurt.
Anyway, I don’t know how to react when asked something like that.
“No, it’s not like that…”
My reply lacked conviction, even to my own ears.
It was obvious I was hiding something.
In times like these, I, with my lacking communication skills, don’t know how to handle things properly.
“Right? There’s no way you’d help someone so boldly if you disliked them.”
Hinase-san smiled.
Judging by her expression, she believed me.
Amazing… She accepted it so easily.
“I see. But I’m in a bind, now I can’t thank you.”
“It’s fine, really, it’s okay.”
I couldn’t let this drag on any longer.
Seizing the opportunity, I shook off her grip on my arm.
“Ah, Amatsuki-san! Where are you going!?”
“Home.”
“Eh, but then my feelings…”
“Please direct those feelings towards a boy in our class.”
“…Why?”
Leaving Hinase-san tilting her head in confusion, I started running again as if escaping.
------------------ 
03 The Heroines Drift Apart
“My Girlfriend Next Door is Super Sweet”
A dating sim that wasn’t particularly famous or a big seller.
My reason for trying it was almost entirely coincidental.
It goes back to the time before I was reborn, when I was a human called Yukitsuki Mashiro.
“Oh, this person started out as a game illustrator.”
At the time, I had found an interesting manga and was researching the author.
I made it a habit to check out all the works by manga artists I liked.
Thinking about it now, perhaps it was a mistake to diligently follow such a self-imposed rule, even though no one asked me to.
“…Why is this protagonist so self-centered? And what’s with these heroines who fall for him?”
I enjoyed reading manga and novels, but this was the first time I’d tried this genre of game.
It was a typical harem game, where the heroines unconditionally fell in love with the protagonist, Shindo Minato.
While the girls had their quirks, they were generally good and cute.
And yet, it was this convenient story where they all fell for the same boy…
Is this a man’s dream?
The strange phenomena unfolding on the screen only made sense when viewed in that light.
Even so, I completed all the scenarios just to see all the illustrated CGs with my own eyes…
◇◇◇
“To think I’d actually become one of those heroines…”
The morning after my reincarnation.
I squinted at the morning sun as I walked to school alone.
The April wind was cold.
Why did I have to become a heroine in such an awkward position, and relive a life in a world so similar to actual Japan?
There’s no change at all.
If I was going to be reborn, I wanted to be a duchess or something.
I wanted to experience something more… like medieval townscapes, magic, that kind of fantasy.
“Yo, Suzuna! Did you come to pick me up again today?!”
“Eh…”
Just as I was stewing in these gloomy feelings, Shindo-kun appeared.
Right…
I was unconsciously following the usual route to school, but apparently this path passes in front of Shindo-kun’s house.
It was a mistake to follow the routine that felt so natural.
Is this the fate of a heroine?
“Hey, hey, why the long face so early in the morning? Come on, cheer up—”
Then, Shindo-kun reached out his hand.
This was the act of patting her head, something he did to cheer up his childhood friend, Amatsuki Suzuna…
“St-Stop it!”
I instinctively raised my voice and jumped back.
“Eh, w-what… What’s wrong, Suzuna? You usually happily offer up the top of your head.”
What kind of line is that?
I didn’t say it out loud, but I had no intention of allowing such a strange act.
“I… I don’t like that kind of thing…”
“What… What’s wrong with you, Suzuna? You’ve been acting strange since yesterday, I’m trying to cheer you up…”
“Being patted by Shindo-kun doesn’t cheer me up.”
“Wha…?!”
Shindo-kun’s jaw dropped.
His expression was comical, but he might actually be hurt.
“Ah, and also, Shindo-kun.”
“Hey, Suzuna. By the way, why have you been calling me “Shindo-kun” since yesterday?! You always called me “Minato-kun”?! I can’t help but feel a distance between us!”
Of course there’s a distance.
That’s Amatsuki Suzuna’s distance, not mine.
I’m sorry, but I have no intention of shortening it any further.
“Anyway, I didn’t come to pick you up, Shindo-kun. I’m going to school now.”
“Hey, wait…!”
As Shindo-kun reached out, still trying to follow me—
“Good morning! Amatsuki-san!”
—A bottomlessly cheerful voice rang out, interrupting him.
It was Hinase Riri, a girl as bright and sparkling as the morning sun.
“Uh, um…”
I was bewildered, not understanding why Hinase-san was suddenly here.
“We’re going to school together today, right?”
Hinase-san approached me with a bright, beaming smile.
But I didn’t remember making such a promise.
“I didn’t make any promi…”
“It’s that thing where our hearts are connected!”
Hinase-san uttered those incomprehensible words as she linked her arm with mine.
Contrary to her cheerful demeanor, her grip felt undeniably firm.
“W-wait, Suzuna…? Why are you with Hinase-san…?”
Shindo-kun stared in disbelief, just as confused as I was.
He probably never imagined such an odd pairing.
“Ah, this girl has something to do with me. Sorry, ‘kay?”
Hinase-san waved her hand gracefully.
“Come on, Amatsuki-san. We’ll be late if we don’t hurry.”
“Eh, uhm…?”
In the end, still unable to comprehend the situation, I started walking, being pulled along by Hinase-san.
◇◇◇
“Ahaha, I didn’t think I’d actually run into you.”
Hinase-san said cheerfully.
I didn’t have enough information to understand what she was talking about.
“Run into me…?”
“Well, yesterday, you ran off in this direction, right, Amatsuki-san? So I thought I might see you if I waited around here, and bingo!”
“You were waiting for me…?”
“Yeah, that’s right.”
She replied as if it were the most natural thing in the world…
“Why…?”
I simply didn’t understand.
“Because you helped me yesterday.”
“I don’t think that’s a good enough reason…”
“Well, well, it’s fine. This way, I was able to help you too, Amatsuki-san.”
“Help me…?”
Was she referring to the incident with Shindo-kun just now?
“Was I wrong? You looked like you were really annoyed, Amatsuki-san, so I thought it was my time to shine and jumped in.”
Ah, I see…
She saw me being bothered by Shindo-kun and helped me.
Our roles had reversed from yesterday.
“No, well… I was in a bit of a bind.”
“Right? I know, I know. It’s so annoying when guys you’re not interested in keep pestering you.”
Well, I don’t want you to think we’re on the same wavelength…
And what do you mean, “guys you’re not interested in”?
“But Hinase-san, you like Shindo-kun, right?”
“…Shindo-kun?”
Hinase-san blinked and tilted her head as if she didn’t know who I was talking about.
“…The boy from earlier.”
“Sorry, I don’t remember. Ah, is he a classmate?”
Well… he is…
Apparently, she hadn’t even noticed him.
Well, I’ve had a personality change, so that’s one thing.
But you’re supposed to be the heroine who falls in love with Shindo Minato.
…This is giving me a headache.
This is my fault… isn’t it?
What do I do? I wonder if she’ll properly fall for Shindo-kun…
I’m determined to keep rejecting him because I don’t want to be a heroine candidate, but it would be troublesome if the other heroines did the same.
I don’t want to imagine a situation where everyone deviates from their routes.
“…Shindo-kun. He’s a boy I recommend, so I was hoping you’d get along.”
“But, Amatsuki-san, you were totally rejecting him, weren’t you?”
Ah…
That’s certainly how it looked.
“I wasn’t rejecting him.”
“But you ran away?”
Ugh… Hinase-san doesn’t believe me because she saw my behavior.
In that case, I’ll tell her the truth.
“…The me before I was reborn, we got along.”
Hearing that, Hinase-san burst out laughing, as if I’d said something funny.
“Did I say something that amusing?”
“No, I just didn’t think you’d tell jokes, Amatsuki-san. You seem so calm and collected, but you’re pretty bold.”
“It’s not a joke, I’m serious.”
“Yeah, yeah, of course. I got it, I’ll check out this ‘Shindo-kun’ next time. He might be my type.”
She totally doesn’t believe me…
Honestly, what’s with this heroine who’s oblivious to the protagonist?
I want her to be more aware of her role as a heroine.
I’ll ignore the fact that this is a self-deprecating statement.
“Um, hey…”
There was one more thing I wanted to say to Hinase-san.
“What?”
“When are you going to let go of my arm?”
Hinase-san had been walking with her arm linked in mine the whole time.
In this chilly season, another person’s warmth was comforting, but…
Now that we were nearing the school, it was just too strange for Amatsuki Suzuna and Hinase Riri to be walking arm in arm.
I wanted her to let go quickly.
“Why? It’s fine, I have things I want to talk about with you, Amatsuki-san.”
I don’t think wanting to talk and linking arms are the same thing…
Looking into Hinase-san’s eyes, I got the feeling she wouldn’t listen to reason.
------------------ 
04 Careful Flag Management
“Um, Hinase-san… we’re almost at school, so could you let go of me?”
I pleaded with Hinase Riri, the girl who was holding my arm and showing no signs of letting go.
“Why? Did you not like it?”
T-Too close…
Why would she think I’d be okay with such sudden closeness…?
Is this the difference between a social butterfly and an introvert?
“No, but it’ll be troublesome if other people at school see us.”
“…Why? I don’t mind.”
Hinase-san tilted her head, looking completely unconcerned.
Is she really such an impartial person…?
But sometimes, that kind of universal love can be tough on introverts.
“No, no… for the Hinase Riri to be seen with a gloomy, corner-dwelling girl like me… it’ll damage your image. It’s better not to.”
“Hey, I’m not that big of a deal to be called ‘the’ Hinase Riri.”
…Is she serious?
Hinase Riri is supposed to be the super popular girl who gets confessions from boys all over the school.
She rejects them all, and the only boy she falls for is Shindo Minato…
Anyway, why is such a wonderful girl clinging to Amatsuki Suzuna, the representative of unremarkable girls?
“Um, Hinase-san. Can I ask you something?”
“Of course.”
“Why are you so eager to talk to me?”
“Because I’m interested in you, Amatsuki-san.”
Such a straightforward expression…
Honest words that I, a twisted person, could never utter.
It’s… kind of embarrassing.
“W-Why are you so interested in me?”
“Because you’re my benefactor, you saved me? Of course I’d be interested.”
…I’ve heard that before.
That’s a line that was meant for Shindo Minato.
It seems that me rescuing her in that situation really was a problem…
W-What do I do?
Two heroines who aren’t interested in the protagonist have been born.
“So, let’s become friends.”
She pressed closer.
…Why is she clinging to me so much?
Is this level of physical contact normal?
I don’t know, being bad at socializing.
Should I just ask her?
“Hinase-san, what do you think of me?”
Ah, even I think that question sounds kind of clingy…
I think my sense of distance is off too.
“Hm? I like you?”
But Hinase-san is also strange.
She’s too straightforward.
…And I want her to direct those words towards Shindo-kun.
Why is one of the heroines telling the childhood friend heroine that she “likes” her?
“What about you, Amatsuki-san? What do you think of me?”
She asked in return.
…W-What do I…
I don’t like or dislike her yet.
“…N-Normal.”
“Eh?”
Hinase-san looked surprised, and her grip loosened.
I seized the opportunity and ran away.
◇◇◇
I sat at my desk in the classroom, holding my head in my hands.
(By the way, my seat is at the back by the window, which is good.)
…What should I do?
Shindo-kun and Hinase-san’s intimacy level hasn’t risen at all.
While I’m just one person, wouldn’t it be a problem if the other heroines are the same?
“…I guess I won’t know until more time passes.”
Fortunately, there are other heroines.
If they connect with Shindo-kun, it might be okay.
Anyway, I’ll just keep quiet so I don’t mess up the direction of this story any further.
I want a peaceful school life.
I don’t want a rom-com with the protagonist, nor a flashy youth entangled with high-ranking girls.
I’ll make sure not to get involved with them anymore.
“Hey, Suzuna. What was that this morning?”
…Just as I was thinking that, Shindo-kun appeared in the classroom and called out to me.
Of course he did, his seat is in front of mine.
It’s troublesome that even our seating arrangement reinforces our childhood friend positions.
“What was what?”
“Walking to school with the school madonna, Hinase Riri. When did you two become so close?”
“…There was an opportunity yesterday.”
“It was so unexpected, I was shocked.”
I know that without you telling me.
“You’re not going to suddenly become a gal, are you?”
“…I’m not. The timing would be weird.”
A high school debut would be one thing, but a personality change now, as a second-year, when relationships are already established, would be crazy.
“Good. I’m relieved.”
“…I don’t understand why that would relieve you, Shindo-kun.”
“Because I want you to be my Suzuna.”
As expected of the protagonist. Such a self-centered statement.
“…I’m… just me.”
I might not be the original Amatsuki Suzuna, but I’m also a plain, inconspicuous girl.
I’ll make sure not to interact with Hinase-san anymore.
I should be able to live a peaceful life from now on.
◇◇◇
Classes ended, and lunchtime arrived.
Shindo-kun, who sits in front of me, stretched widely.
“Haaa… It’s over…”
Then he turned around to face me.
“Suzuna, lunch?”
“…”
That’s right.
This childhood friend diligently provided Shindo-kun with lunch every day without fail.
“I don’t have one.”
“…Seriously?”
Speaking of which, I forgot to prepare my own lunch too.
“I… can’t cook. From now on, please prepare your own.”
“Eh! But Suzuna, you’re such a good cook! Why?!”
“…A slump.”
“Is that a thing with cooking?!”
I don’t know.
But since I share her memories, I might be able to do it if I tried.
However, I have absolutely no intention of cooking.
Even if I have the skill, it’s meaningless if I lack the motivation.
“…W-What am I going to do? I’ll starve to death!”
Shindo-kun glared at me resentfully, as if he couldn’t accept it.
…That’s an exaggeration.
—Clatter
The classroom door opened.
“Onii-chan! I brought your lunch!”
Shindo-kun’s savior appeared.
Pink twintails, a petite and adorable girl.
Unlike Hinase-san, who clearly broke the school rules, her skirt length, pushing the boundaries but still within regulations, made her strangely relatable.
“K-Kokona…?! What are you doing here?!”
The girl who appeared carrying a lunch bag was Shindo Kokona.
As you can probably guess from her name, she’s Shindo Minato’s younger sister.
A new first-year student who started this spring, one year younger than us.
Also one of the heroines.
“I said, your lunch! Onii-chan, you went to school before Kokona finished preparing it!”
“Eh?! Why would you do that?!”
“Because Onii-chan always eats Amatsuki Suzuna’s lunch, right?! I figured you’d be trying to eat hers today too… but there’s none?!”
As you can probably tell, Shindo Kokona is a complete brocon.
Therefore, she’s always felt a sense of rivalry towards Amatsuki Suzuna, who has been close to Shindo Minato since childhood.
Now that she’s finally enrolled in the same school, she’s trying to take the initiative…
“Good for you, Shindo-kun. Now you can have lunch.”
As I chimed in, Kokona-chan turned towards me.
“Amatsuki Suzuna, you didn’t make Onii-chan lunch?!”
She addressed me informally even though I’m her senpai, probably because she sees me as a rival for Shindo Minato’s affections.
I’m the type who doesn’t care about seniority, so I’ll ignore it.
“Yeah, I’m not cooking anymore.”
“Does that mean… you’re giving Onii-chan to Kokona?”
…What a bombshell.
Well, she was always a high-strung character in the game, but…
It’s impressive how boldly she states it.
Incidentally, this part originally leads to a scene where Amatsuki Suzuna, who is usually quiet, unusually refuses to give in.
It’s a moment where you can glimpse her single-minded devotion to Shindo Minato…
“Giving him, giving him. Be happy together.”
“Wha…?! Amatsuki Suzuna approved?!”
I showed Kokona-chan that I had no intention of resisting.
“Hey! Kokona, don’t talk about me like I’m some object you can ‘give away’!!”
“That’s not… That’s not what I meant…!!”
And so, the two of them misunderstood each other.
He’s an oblivious protagonist, so her intentions went completely over his head.
Do your best, Kokona-chan. I won’t get in your way.
“Ah, Amatsuki-san. You don’t have lunch?”
Then, for some reason, Hinase-san appeared.
She usually eats lunch with the popular crowd, so why…?
“I don’t, but…”
“I forgot to bring mine today too. Want to go buy something together?”
And she was already holding my hand.
A silent pressure, or rather, a forceful act, saying “Let’s go”.
What a steely mentality, considering I ran away from her this morning.
Unable to refuse Hinase Riri’s invitation in front of the whole class, I was dragged away.
“…Ah, Amatsuki Suzuna is being corrupted by a gal.”
And from behind me, I heard Kokona-chan’s baseless misunderstanding.
------------------ 
05 I Wasn’t Told It Would Be This Tiring at the School Store
Hinase-san took my hand and led me out into the hallway.
“So, shall we go buy something at the school store?”
She invited me with a smile.
…For some reason, her grip on my hand was firm, and it didn’t feel like I had much of a choice.
“W-Why with me…?”
“Because you didn’t make lunch either, Amatsuki-san, right?”
That’s true, but…
That doesn’t mean she has to go with me.
“You could go with your friends.”
“But you’re my friend.”
Hinase-san pointed at me.
“…?”
Not understanding what she meant, I looked behind me.
No one was there.
“Hey, isn’t that reaction a bit harsh?”
Hinase-san wore a terribly sad expression.
“…You mean I’m your friend, Hinase-san?”
“Is there any other option?”
When did I become friends with Hinase Riri?
….
No way, no way, impossible.
Introverts are allowed to exist because they stay in the corner, in the shadows.
Standing shoulder to shoulder with a social butterfly, basking in the sun at the center of the class…
It’s too out of place, I’d be laughed at.
No, that’s not even the worst part.
The other girls would definitely hate me.
They’d definitely target me as the brown-nosing introvert trying to suck up to Hinase Riri.
“…We’re classmates, right?”
“Isn’t that a bit distant?”
Hinase-san’s mouth dropped open in surprise.
“…I feel like it’s still too early to call us friends.”
In reality, Amatsuki Suzuna didn’t have any real friends.
She was just inconspicuous and harmless, so no one disliked her.
But she didn’t have any particularly close friends either.
That’s the kind of girl she was.
“Ahh, is that so? I don’t think it’s something to think so deeply about.”
“But we’ve only just started talking, Hinase-san…”
“If our vibes match, isn’t that enough?”
…No, I think our vibes are the least compatible.
“Well, whatever. Then we just need to talk lots and become good friends, right? Okay, let’s go.”
“Ah, wait a minute…”
Hinase-san started walking, chuckling.
Since she was holding my hand, I had to follow…
“D-Doesn’t it bother you…?”
I thought my reactions to Hinase-san were terrible.
She said she “liked” me, and I replied “normal.”
She said we were “friends,” and I replied “classmates.”
…No matter how I think about it, it seems natural that she’d be offended.
“Not really. It’s more tiring to be treated nicely by someone who doesn’t actually like you.”
Is that how it is?
“Besides, Amatsuki-san, you’re interested in me, aren’t you?”
“W-What makes you say that?”
“Otherwise, you wouldn’t have saved me from that creepy guy in the suit.”
…So it always comes back to that.
I cursed my own shallow actions right after being reborn.
◇◇◇
The school store was more crowded than I expected.
“Ahh, it’s always crowded during lunch break.”
“It is.”
…Or rather, too crowded.
Students were crammed into a space that wasn’t exactly large.
It was so chaotic, I felt a little overwhelmed.
“But we’ll get hungry if we don’t buy something. Let’s get in line.”
“O-Okay…”
I wasn’t enthusiastic at all, but my hand was still being held.
I had no choice but to obediently follow.
We joined the back of the line.
…After a while, I noticed something strange.
“Aren’t we being stared at?”
It was hard to tell because of the crowd, but the students’ gazes were clearly focused on us.
Both boys and girls, but the stares from the boys were especially intense.
…Well, I quickly understood why.
“Sorry. I might have mentioned this before, but I seem to attract attention. People often say my voice and the way I talk are loud, so it’s probably that.”
…Oh, come on.
Not satisfied with just the protagonist, this heroine is also oblivious?
I knew it, but seeing it firsthand makes me want to call it an act.
“It’s not that, I think it’s because you’re beautiful, Hinase-san.”
“…Eh?”
“It’s not ‘eh.’ I know you get a lot of confessions, right? You’re popular, aren’t you? So it’s not because of your voice or the way you talk… no way.”
“Hehe…”
Huh, for some reason Hinase-san looked pleased…
“What are you laughing about…?”
“Nothing, it’s just that you think I’m beautiful, Amatsuki-san.”
“…Ah.”
I-I messed up…
I’m such an idiot.
It’s true, but what am I doing saying something that makes Hinase-san happy?
I don’t want to raise her affinity any further…!
“I-It’s just an objective fact…”
“I’m happy you think so, Amatsuki-san. So, see? We should be friends, right?”
“No, we shouldn’t!”
“Ehhh…”
No, no, no.
Raising strange flags is bad.
I’ll refrain from saying anything complimentary.
◇◇◇
“…Finally got it.”
With a sandwich in hand, my spoils of war, I was once again walking down the hallway with Hinase-san holding my hand.
“That took longer than I thought.”
The time wasn’t the only issue, the mental damage was greater.
…I realized partway through that the stares weren’t just directed at Hinase Riri, but at me too.
I think they were skeptical stares, like “Who’s that plain girl next to her?”
That made me even more tired of being in that space.
“Kids who don’t bring lunch do this every day. I can’t handle this.”
Hinase-san recalled the chaos with a mix of awe and exhaustion.
I definitely can’t handle it either.
The crowd is one thing, but the strange stares are just as bad.
And it’s all because Hinase-san forgot her lunch.
If she had been more responsible, this wouldn’t have happened.
I conveniently ignored my own role in this.
“…It’s rare for you to forget your lunch, Hinase-san.”
“Eh, is it?”
“Yeah, because you make it yourself, right? You seem pretty diligent when it comes to cooking.”
“…Eh?”
Huh, Hinase-san’s eyes widened.
That’s strange. I don’t think I said anything off the mark.
And I didn’t say anything complimentary this time either.
“Did I say something weird?”
“No, it’s just that I’ve never told you that I cook or make my own lunch. I was just thinking you knew a lot about me.”
“…Ah.”
Ahhh… I’m such an idiot…
My prior knowledge, my prior knowledge from playing the game…
I know things I shouldn’t know because I’ve already completed it.
“What, what? You said you thought I was ‘normal,’ but you’re totally interested in me, aren’t you, Amatsuki-san?”
“No, I’m not!”
“Then how does a ‘classmate’ like you, Amatsuki-san, know something that only my ‘friends’ know~?”
Hinase-san beamed at me, trying to read my expression.
T-Too close… Too close…!
“Any classmate would know that much. It’s just rumors.”
“Ehh…? I haven’t heard any rumors about you making lunch, Amatsuki-san.”
Stop treating me like I’m the same as you.
No one’s interested in Amatsuki Suzuna’s information, so of course there wouldn’t be any rumors.
Forget it, I’ll just forcefully change the subject.
I feel like I’ll only reveal more flaws if she keeps digging.
“So, why did you forget your lunch, Hinase-san? I asked you earlier, so answer me.”
“I told you this morning, I wanted to walk to school with you, Amatsuki-san. I woke up early and waited, so I didn’t have time to make lunch.”
Ah, so that’s why.
In the end, it’s all my fault, damn it.
------------------ 
06 A Slight Discrepancy
“Is that all you’re having for lunch?”
Hinase-san tilted her head curiously, looking at the sandwich in my left hand.
My right hand was still trapped in her grip.
“Yeah, this is enough.”
“Seriously? You’re a light eater, Amatsuki-san.”
Hinase-san’s free hand held a transparent plastic bag.
Inside were a hamburger bento, salad, melon bread, snacks, chocolate, and a plastic bottle of tea.
My sandwich was exposed, while Hinase-san’s various purchases were contained within the bag.
…Hinase-san eats quite a lot, surprisingly.
There weren’t any detailed descriptions of how much she ate when I played the original game.
There was no mention of portion sizes during date meals either…
Or maybe she was just putting on an act in front of Shindo-kun?
A girl in love probably feels self-conscious about eating a lot in front of the person she likes.
Seeing that side of her made her seem kind of cute.
“Oh, right. Let’s eat lunch together, Amatsuki-san.”
Hinase-san invited me as casually as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
…It didn’t seem like a bad suggestion.
I’m not so steely-hearted as to willingly choose to eat alone.
It’s just that I have a tendency to push people away…
It’s not like I never want to be with someone.
Besides, I’ve gotten a little used to Hinase-san, so it might be okay…
“Okay.”
But just as I was about to say it, my throat tightened.
“…On second thought, no.”
“Rejected again!”
Because if I did, I would inevitably end up eating with Hinase-san’s popular group.
A plain girl with glasses mixed in with a circle of sparkling high school girls… a complete anomaly.
I can’t imagine it being a pleasant experience for either of us.
“Because I’d feel out of place.”
“Eh? That’s not true. You’re interesting, Amatsuki-san, and everyone’s easygoing, they’ll accept you.”
…No, non-verbal communication like that, with all the high energy and banter, is what I’m worst at.
The more I think about it, the more I imagine myself sticking out like a sore thumb.
I’ll refuse.
“No.”
“So stubborn!”
Hinase-san swung our joined arms back and forth.
“Come on, it’s more fun to eat together!”
Hinase-san wouldn’t back down.
What do I do? What can I say to convince her?
I racked my brain for another reason.
“…After school.”
“After school?”
Hinase-san asked back, puzzled.
“Let’s go eat something after school. I turned down your offer of thanks yesterday, Hinase-san.”
“Ooh.”
Hinase-san stared intently at me.
Her eyes were a beautiful almond shape, and her already large pupils were wide and sparkling.
“I-If you don’t want to, it’s totally fine. I don’t particularly need you to thank me…”
“No, no! Let’s do that!”
“S-So, we’re eating separately for lunch…”
“Okay. That’s a shame, but I’ll be looking forward to after school!”
…Hmm.
I agreed to her request so she’d listen to mine, but…
I wonder if this was the right thing to do. I’m worried.
◇◇◇
“Ugh… bleh…”
Back in the classroom, Shindo-kun was slumped over his desk, his face pale.
He was making strange noises, and he didn’t look well.
“…Are you okay?”
It was concerning to hear those weird noises right before I was about to eat.
I’d prefer him to act normal.
“Ah, uh… Suzuna. Hey, um, what do you think if… the tamagoyaki was sour?”
“…I’d think the seasoning was wrong.”
“What if the stir-fried vegetables were incredibly hard?”
“I’d think they weren’t cooked through.”
“What if the rice was crunchy?”
“I’d think it wasn’t cooked properly.”
“That… that’s it.”
That’s right, Kokona-chan is a terrible cook.
That’s why Shindo-kun was so insistent on Amatsuki Suzuna’s lunch.
I forgot.
“But you ate it all. You’re a good older brother.”
“She… watched me until I finished it all. I ate it like my life depended on it, and this is the result.”
“…She’s a thoughtful little sister.”
“Think about it, Suzuna. My little sister brought me lunch to the classroom and wouldn’t leave. It looks like I’m obsessed with her! Everyone’s staring, I couldn’t take it.”
Well, I understand what he means.
Still, it’s not normal for a younger sister to be so devoted.
It might be more trouble than it’s worth, but I also feel like he should appreciate her love a little more.
“…So please, Suzuna. Make me lunch tomorrow. My life depends on it.”
“Impossible. Look, I only have a sandwich.”
“Then what am I supposed to do tomorrow…?!”
“Eat Kokona-chan’s lunch.”
“Are you saying you don’t care if I die, Suzuna…?!”
Such an exaggeration…
Besides, Kokona-chan’s cooking will improve.
If you go down her route, her skills dramatically improve, and she learns to cook just the way Shindo-kun likes it.
In that respect, she has a family advantage.
Knowing that, I’m not worried.
“More importantly, please stop making those weird noises.”
“That’s all you’re worried about?! Suzuna, don’t you have anything else to say?!”
“…I’d also like you to stop calling me by my first name.”
“That’s not the point!” Shindo-kun shouted.
“Is there any other way to call you?!”
“Amatsuki-san.”
“We’re childhood friends, aren’t we?!”
“There’s such a thing as politeness even between close friends.”
“Isn’t that way too distant?! We’re not even close anymore at that point!”
“Yes.”
“You agree?!”
Well, lowering my affection level this much should be fine.
I’ll leave the rest to Kokona-chan.
“If you have the energy to shout like that, you’ll be fine. I’m going to eat my sandwich, so be quiet.”
“No, this is what you call a ‘tsukkomi.’ And to tell me to be quiet after making me shout… that’s a pretty advanced…”
I silently opened my sandwich wrapper.
I chose an egg sandwich.
I peeled off the sticker and pulled it open.
Opening the clear plastic bag, I picked one up and brought it to my mouth.
The bread was fluffy.
“…That’s unusual.”
Shindo-kun looked at me eating and spoke curiously.
“I told you to be quiet.”
“I’m not allowed to say a single word?!”
“No. Face forward.”
“You’re rejecting even my gaze?!”
It’s one thing if we were eating together, but it’s unsettling to be stared at while I eat.
“It’s distracting. Come on, face forward.”
“Fine, I’ll turn around, I’ll turn around, but… since when did you start eating egg sandwiches?”
“…Eh?”
That was a slightly unsettling question.
“Well, Suzuna, your sandwiches were always ham and lettuce, or potato salad, right? You always said, ‘Egg is good, but I like these better.’”
“…Did I?”
That was information I didn’t even know from the game.
Even though I share her memories as Amatsuki Suzuna, our preferences are different…
Well, I guess it’s natural for there to be some differences.
And hardly anyone would notice anyway.
Probably only her childhood friend, Shindo-kun.
“With your changed attitude and now your different food preferences, you seem like a different person.”
“Eh…”
My heart skipped a beat at those words.
It was a little scary that he could see through me with just that much.
“…It was the only one left.”
“I see,” Shindo-kun said, seemingly convinced, and turned back around.
It’s nothing.
I’m not the real Amatsuki Suzuna, after all.
It’s natural for there to be some differences.
A discrepancy this small shouldn’t be a problem.
Chewing thoughtfully, I swallowed the sandwich along with my anxieties.
The egg was properly sweet.
------------------ 
07 The After-School Rendezvous
After school, the time of liberation from the confines of school.
“Alright, Suzuna. Let’s go home.”
Shindo-kun turned around and called out to me.
My next shackle appeared right before my eyes.
“Ah, no—”
I started to say, “I have something to do today,” when—
—BAM!!
“Onii-chan, let’s go home!!”
Kokona-chan appeared.
“K-Kokona… Listen, Onii-chan has something to do—”
“No, you don’t! You’re just going home!”
“No… Suzu—”
“You don’t need to go home with Amatsuki Suzuna! Kokona’s here!”
Kokona-chan’s vehemence clearly won out.
Normally, Amatsuki Suzuna would join the fray here, and the situation would descend into chaos, but…
“Be careful going home, you two.”
“Amatsuki Suzuna, are you giving this up too?!”
Kokona-chan seemed deflated by my easy acceptance.
“Yeah, I have something to do today…”
I glanced towards the center of the classroom.
There was Hinase-san, chatting and laughing with her friends.
I knew that interacting with her more in class would only draw more unwanted attention.
“See you tomorrow then. Shindo-kun, Kokona-chan.”
I said goodbye to the two of them and quickly left the classroom.
“…Onii-chan, did you do something to Amatsuki Suzuna?”
“I didn’t do anything!”
“…Your popularity streak is over, huh, Onii-chan.”
“When did I even have one?!”
◇◇◇
I waited for Hinase-san in the corner of the hallway, near the entrance.
The setting sun streamed through the window, dyeing the scenery crimson.
Students heading to club activities and those going straight home passed by.
Either way, their footsteps seemed light.
Meanwhile, I fidgeted restlessly.
“Thinking about it calmly… going somewhere after school with Hinase-san also seems like a pretty bold move…”
Spending time after school with Hinase Riri, a beautiful girl who even adults would hesitate to approach…
Is such a thing possible for me?
Wouldn’t I end up doing something strange?
“…M-Maybe I should go home.”
The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I became.
It’s not too late.
I could still go home and pretend this never happened.
Yes, that’s what I’ll do.
Once I decided, my feet started moving towards the entrance on their own.
“Ah, there you are, Amatsuki-san! Don’t go ahead without me, I was looking for you!”
…But unfortunately, Hinase-san, coming down the stairs, spotted me.
God seems to be telling me to keep my promise.
“S-Sorry…. I thought I’d wait here since you were talking, Hinase-san.”
“Then you should have waited in the classroom. I didn’t know where you were.”
“…I should have told you.”
Even if I didn’t want to be in the classroom with her, I should have at least done that much.
I guess my desire to escape made me rush.
“Ah, let’s exchange contact information.”
“…Eh?”
Hinase-san took out her phone.
It had a pale pink cover with a character illustration.
I thought it suited her.
“Here.”
She opened her messaging app, ready to exchange contact information.
It felt like she was closing the distance between us more and more.
“…Um.”
But I wasn’t keen on it.
“This way, it doesn’t matter who’s around, right?”
“…Yeah.”
But I didn’t have a clear reason to refuse.
Overwhelmed by Hinase-san’s momentum, I exchanged contact information.
I stared at her phone, frozen.
Hinase-san’s profile picture was of her sitting in a loose hoodie and shorts against a backdrop of a pure white wall and antique furniture reminiscent of Scandinavia.
…Cute.
She didn’t look out of place in such a stylish setting.
Or rather, why does she look so cute even in such simple clothes?
The hoodie was gray, and the shorts were black.
A completely ordinary outfit, yet cute.
It could only be explained by her beautiful features and good figure.
“Um, Amatsuki-san? What’s wrong? Why are you staring at my phone so much?”
“…No, it’s just, you’re cheating, Hinase-san.”
“Eh, what is?”
“Looking this cute in such normal clothes… Give me a break. If I wore that, it would just be pajamas.”
“Ah, uh… you saw that.”
“And is this picture edited? It’s not, is it?”
“Eh, what are you talking about all of a sudden?”
“There’s natural beauty, and then there’s this. No one can compete with this.”
Now I was starting to feel sorry for the popular girls who hung out with Hinase-san.
Trying to stand next to such a radiant girl would probably crush your pride.
“Well, look. I did edit my legs to make them thinner.”
“Ehh…?”
At her words, I swiped and zoomed in on the picture.
“Hey, don’t zoom in on just my legs… It’s embarrassing.”
I compared the picture with her actual legs peeking out from her short school uniform skirt.
“They’re the same.”
Long, slender, beautiful legs.
Basically, her legs were so long, they were on a different level from ordinary people.
“A-Are you… complimenting me?”
Hinase-san’s cheeks seemed slightly flushed.
I wonder why.
She must be used to hearing this kind of thing, and there’s no reason for her to be shy about my words.
Maybe it’s so obvious that she’s thinking, “Don’t state the obvious.”
◇◇◇
I walked through the after-school streets alongside the naturally beautiful Hinase-san.
…It was probably because I saw that picture.
I was reminded once again of the vast distance between us, and felt uncomfortable.
“Is there anything you want to eat, Amatsuki-san?”
“…Hmm. Nothing in particular.”
“Anything you want to drink?”
“…I’m not really thirsty.”
Hinase-san gave a clearly troubled laugh.
“Well, I can’t do anything with that.”
“That’s true, so…”
I tried to think, but I couldn’t concentrate.
The reason was the stares from those around us.
As expected, Hinase Riri stands out.
As always, the gazes of passersby (mostly men) were focused on her, and I felt awkward standing next to her.
“…Is something bothering you?”
Hinase-san noticed my state and spoke to me in a rather concerned voice.
“No, I just feel bad that a mob character like me is walking next to you, Hinase-san…”
“Mob character…?”
“An unremarkable girl.”
Good grief.
Anyway, let’s go into a store, quickly finish what we need to do, and say goodbye.
“You’re cute, Amatsuki-san.”
But Hinase-san said that in a rather serious voice.
“…Are you just being nice? I appreciate the sentiment, but I understand my own limitations, so it’s okay.”
Hinase-san is kind, so she’s probably just trying to compliment me.
But it’s not an accurate assessment.
“Cute” refers to girls like Hinase-san, with beautiful features and who take care of themselves.
It definitely doesn’t refer to an unremarkable girl like me.
“I mean it.”
…Hm?
Her words, spoken with more intensity than before, reached my ears, and I couldn’t ignore them. I looked at Hinase-san.
Her lips were pressed firmly together, and her eyes were fixed on me.
“I seriously think you’re cute, Amatsuki-san.”
…Putting it in Hinase-san’s terms, she was being super serious.
------------------ 
08 Cold Fingertips
“I’m cute…?”
Hinase-san’s statement was wrong.
Let me reiterate.
Amatsuki Suzuna is plain.
Black hair deliberately styled in pigtails, thick-lensed black-rimmed glasses.
Her uniform buttoned all the way up, her skirt a proper length below the knee.
And to top it all off, no makeup, no effort to dress up.
No matter how you look at it, she’s unremarkable.
“Hinase-san, do you know the meaning of the word ‘cute’?”
I don’t know in what sense Hinase-san was using “cute,” but I think it’s a bad habit to use it for everything.
“I know what it means, and look.”
—Touch
Without any warning, Hinase-san touched my cheek.
Her fingertips were cool, leaving only a trace of coldness.
“Wh-What?!”
I flinched and recoiled.
Being touched so suddenly startled me.
“As I thought, your skin is soft, and you’re so fair with fine pores. Super beautiful skin.”
“Th-That’s because I don’t go out much. And I don’t wear makeup, so my skin doesn’t get damaged.”
Someone like Hinase-san, who wears makeup every day and is always going out, probably puts a lot of stress on her skin.
In contrast, I do nothing, so my skin is stress-free. That’s all it is.
“So you’re saying it’s for your skin’s sake? You’re such a hard worker.”
“H-How did you come to that conclusion…?”
Her thinking is too positive.
Or am I just too cynical…?
I often get confused when talking to Hinase-san.
“Let me touch it.”
Hinase-san’s finger reached out again.
“No.”
I clasped my hands together to block her fingertips.
Hinase-san’s fingertips were still cold.
It might be because we’re outside, but being touched by such cold hands isn’t pleasant.
“Your hands are warm, Amatsuki-san.”
I think it’s just that her fingertips are too cold, but relatively speaking, mine feel warm.
Hinase-san stared at my hand gripping hers, seemingly savoring the warmth.
“Yours are cold, Hinase-san. I’ll freeze to death if you keep touching me with those hands.”
“That’s an exaggeration. It just means my heart is warm.”
“So you’re saying my heart is cold.”
I have a feeling she’s right.
“The way you’re so guarded is also cute, like a cat.”
Hinase-san is tall, so compared to her, I’m short.
So maybe my small stature and hunched posture make me seem like a small animal.
“That doesn’t make sense.”
“Say ‘meow.’”
“I’m not saying that.”
Hinase-san’s words and actions were nonsensical.
“Forget it, let’s just go. Where are we going?”
I was also getting tired of the stares from those around us.
I’m sure some of them were eavesdropping on our conversation.
Even though Hinase-san is obviously the beautiful one, it’s uncomfortable to be the one being called cute.
“Eh, but you don’t seem very enthusiastic, Amatsuki-san…”
“That’s not true. Let’s go somewhere you recommend, Hinase-san.”
“Is it okay if it’s something I like?”
“Yeah, anything you like is fine.”
Or rather, I don’t have any preferences.
I’m the type of person who just eats and drinks whatever’s available.
It’s better to leave it to Hinase-san.
“Okay, then this way.”
She returned the grip on my hand.
I followed Hinase-san.
Her fingertips gradually warmed up, as if my body heat was transferring to her.
◇◇◇
The place Hinase-san took me to was a cafe.
The space was mainly wood, with potted plants here and there.
Soft orange lighting created a gentle atmosphere.
“…Unexpected.”
I blurted out without thinking.
“Eh, really?”
“Yeah, I thought you’d go to a more flashy place, Hinase-san.”
“Flashy?”
“I don’t know, like a party place with lots of ‘woo-hoo!’”
“What’s that? That’s hilarious.”
Hinase-san laughed and sat at a table by the window.
I followed her and sat opposite her.
The sofa was a muted green fabric, slightly fuzzy with long fibers.
…I’ve never been to a place like this before.
Hinase-san sat down without talking to the waiter or anything. She must be used to this.
I felt the gap between her world and mine even more keenly.
“What do you want to drink, Amatsuki-san?”
She handed me a menu, and I looked it over.
There were a lot of coffee and tea options, but I don’t really like either.
“…Orange juice, please.”
“Seriously?”
Hinase-san seemed surprised by my choice.
“Eh, is that weird?”
“No, it’s not weird, but… Sorry, do you not like this kind of place?”
It’s not that, but I’m not adventurous with drinks, so I’ll just order juice.
“Do you want anything to eat?”
“…What’s good here?”
There were various items on the menu, but I didn’t know what to choose.
“The scones are good. But the pancakes are probably the most popular.”
Here we go, pancakes.
A food whose true identity, bread or cake, is unknown.
But looking at the picture…
“They look delicious.”
“You’ve never had them before?”
“No.”
Not at a fancy place like this.
“No way, seriously?”
Hinase-san seemed surprised again.
“But I’m not sure I can finish this by myself.”
Judging by the picture, the pancakes looked quite large.
“Ah, I know! Why don’t we share?”
Hinase-san’s voice brightened as if she’d had a great idea.
I don’t really understand, but she seems determined to have me try the pancakes.
“Hmm… I’m fine with it, but are you okay with that, Hinase-san?”
“Eh, I’m fine, but why?”
“From the way you were talking, it sounded like you could finish it by yourself.”
“…It’s fine. Actually, it’s better that way. Otherwise, I’ll just keep eating forever.”
Hinase-san’s demeanor suddenly darkened.
I wonder what’s wrong. She seemed to feel guilty about eating.
…She ate quite a bit at lunchtime too. I wonder if she’s worried about it.
But she’s plenty thin, she doesn’t need to worry.
“Excuse me, can we order?”
Hinase-san raised her hand and called the waiter.
He was a young man with refreshing short hair.
…They look good together.
A handsome cafe waiter and a beautiful gal.
A very good match.
“—Is that all?”
“Yes, please.”
After taking our order, the waiter returned to the counter.
Hinase-san, having finished ordering, turned her gaze back to me.
“Hinase-san, is that… your type?”
“Wait, isn’t that a little sudden?”
“Eh, is it?”
“The timing is terrible.”
Well, that’s true. Normally, I wouldn’t ask.
But honestly, I know Hinase-san’s type.
It’s Shindo Minato.
But I was curious about what kind of person she likes after deviating from that route.
“You’re famous for not dating anyone even though you’re so popular, Hinase-san. I’m sure there were plenty of cool guys, weren’t there?”
“Hmm… how should I put it? I don’t really get the whole ‘cool guy’ thing.”
Well… she likes the unremarkable protagonist, after all.
Maybe looks aren’t important to her.
“Then, what’s the deciding factor?”
“Let me see…”
Hinase-san pursed her lips in thought, then quickly relaxed them.
“Someone who cares about me and protects me, I guess.”
“That’s a wide range…”
“Maybe. What about you, Amatsuki-san?”
Eh, me…?
I’ve never been in love.
I don’t really know, but if I had to say…
“Someone who takes the lead.”
I’m shy.
So I’ve thought it would be nice to have someone who understands that and helps me.
But I’ve never thought someone like that would like me.
“I see. That’ll be fine then.”
“…What is?”
Hinase-san nodded in understanding, which I found a little strange.
------------------ 
09 To Friends
“Oh…”
The waiter placed our order on the table.
I couldn’t help but let out a gasp at the sight.
Fluffy pancakes topped with whipped cream, strawberries, and strawberry sauce.
I’d seen pictures and videos, but seeing it in person was completely different.
“These are really good here.”
Saying that, Hinase-san picked up a knife and fork and began cutting the pancakes.
She cut a bite-sized piece, stabbed it with her fork, and lifted it.
“Here, say ‘ahh.’”
Hinase-san held out the pancake with a grin.
I had no idea what she found so amusing.
“What are you doing? I can eat it myself.”
“Come on, let me feed you.”
I really wanted to stab the pancake with my own fork.
But unfortunately, there was only one serving of pancakes and one set of cutlery.
In other words, I had no way to eat the pancakes other than through Hinase-san.
…I couldn’t just grab it with my hands.
“Come on, come on, it’s the pancake you were looking forward to, Amatsuki-san.”
Hinase-san temptingly wiggled the pancake.
It was like feeding a pet.
“It’s not good to play with your food.”
“Then eat it quickly. Here you go.”
Hinase-san extended her arm.
Before my eyes was a pancake covered in whipped cream stained pink with strawberry sauce.
This was torture…
—Nibble
Unable to resist any longer, I took a bite.
The soft texture and subtle sweetness filled my mouth, combined with the sweetness of the whipped cream and the tartness of the strawberries.
“How is it?”
“…It’s good.”
“That’s the first time I’ve seen someone say something’s delicious while sounding so grumpy.”
Hinase-san continued to look at me with amusement.
“I was just thinking it would taste even better if I could eat it myself.”
“Eh, it’s fine, it’s just this much.”
Saying that, Hinase-san continued cutting the pancakes.
She glanced at me.
“Want another bite?”
“I’ll eat it myself. You should eat too, Hinase-san.”
“You’re right.”
Hinase-san was about to bring the pancake to her mouth when she stopped abruptly.
“What’s wrong?”
“Amatsuki-san, will you feed me?”
Hinase-san’s eyes sparkled.
Did she really want me to do that?
“No, eat it yourself.”
“Aww, too bad.”
As Hinase-san brought the pancake to her mouth, a strand of hair fell loose.
Tucking it behind her ear, she exposed the skin of her neck.
Her bare skin was fair and smooth.
Even the simple act of eating looked picturesque. As expected of a beautiful girl.
She finally brought the pancake to her mouth, her shapely lips moving as she chewed.
“…It’s kind of hard to eat when you’re staring at me like that.”
“Now you know how I feel.”
“Not really. You’re still going to eat more, right, Amatsuki-san?”
Hinase-san placed her knife and fork on the plate.
She slid the plate closer to me.
“…I will.”
This time, I used the knife and fork myself and brought a piece of pancake to my mouth.
The sweetness spread through my mouth.
But being watched by Hinase-san while I ate still bothered me.
“Hey, didn’t you say you didn’t like sweets, Amatsuki-san?”
“…Did I say that?”
“You did. Yesterday, right after you helped me, I tried to thank you and asked if you liked sweets, and you said you didn’t.”
I actually remember. I said that so I wouldn’t have to accept her offer.
Besides, I’m not sociable enough to readily share my preferences with others.
If asked about my preferences, I’d just brush it off with “normal” or “I don’t like it.”
I’m aware that I’m a difficult person.
“I like sweets.”
“Then why did you lie?”
Hinase-san’s gaze pierced me.
She’s always smiling, but at times like this, her expression becomes serious.
I didn’t like that atmosphere.
“…It’s nothing. I’m just embarrassed to tell people what I like.”
That’s the truth.
Keeping my distance from others is a habit of mine.
It won’t change, and I don’t really want it to.
It’s best to keep a healthy distance from others.
That way, I won’t get hurt, and I won’t hurt anyone else.
I think it’s best for everyone, nothing but good can come of it.
“So, that means we’re close now.”
“…Eh?”
That caught me off guard.
“Because you don’t tell other people your preferences, right? I know now, so that means we’re close.”
…Hinase-san relentlessly closed the distance I tried to maintain.
It bothered me somewhere deep inside.
It was a place within me, normally unstimulated, that I couldn’t quite pinpoint.
But it made me feel restless, like I couldn’t stay still.
“You only found out because of the conversation.”
“But I still found out.”
“That’s true, but…”
“We’re friends now.”
Hinase-san smiled.
It’s unfair how she can soften the atmosphere at a time like this after being so serious just a moment ago.
Her expression made me feel relieved.
“We even exchanged contact information, so we can’t just be classmates anymore, can we?”
“…Well, I guess not.”
“Say it.”
Hinase-san leaned closer across the table, listening intently.
Since her hair was still tucked behind her ears, even her soft-looking ears were exposed.
“…Say what?”
“That we’re friends.”
“…”
I didn’t want to.
“Come on, don’t be silent, I won’t know if you don’t say it.”
But she wouldn’t be satisfied if I didn’t say it.
“…‘We’re friends.’”
“You’re totally doing that on purpose, aren’t you?”
Hinase-san puffed out her cheeks.
She looked cute like that, but it might not be good to provoke her any further.
I decided to obediently comply.
“…Hinase-san and I are friends.”
“Yes, that’s right!”
This time, Hinase-san’s voice was filled with genuine joy.
I felt restless and couldn’t look her in the eye.
To avoid the awkward silence and appear normal, I took a bite of the pancake.
…However.
“The pancake… has lost its flavor…”
“Eh, why?”
I think it’s because of the emotions welling up inside me.
Hinase-san was invading the space within me that was supposed to be empty.
I can remain calm because there’s nothing there, but she’s disrupting that.
But for some reason, I didn’t feel annoyed.
It was strange, but I knew it was because it was Hinase-san.
------------------ 
10 The Imouto Heroine’s Indignation
The alarm on my phone blared in the morning.
I opened my eyes and forced myself to get out of bed, my body heavy as lead.
Rubbing my eyes, I checked my phone and saw a message from Hinase-san.
“I had fun today. Let’s go again sometime.”
The message was from last night.
It was followed by a sticker of a white bear walking happily.
“…I didn’t reply, did I? Come to think of it.”
Hinase-san’s message arrived after I’d gotten into bed.
I briefly wondered how to reply, but the timing was bad.
I still haven’t adjusted to this life, and I’m exhausted.
I fell asleep almost instantly.
“I need to reply.”
I sent a sticker of a penguin saluting with the word “Roger.”
It was simple, but if I tried to type a message, I’d probably spend a while agonizing over it, so I decided against it.
I don’t have time for that in the morning.
I finally managed to drag myself out of bed.
◇◇◇
Amatsuki Suzuna’s mornings start early.
That’s because she has the role of waking up her classmate and childhood friend, Shindo Minato.
“…Seriously, wake yourself up in the morning.”
Of course, I’m not doing that anymore.
His little sister, Kokona-chan, will wake him up even if I leave him alone, and if he oversleeps, it’s his own responsibility.
It’s certainly not my fault or my duty.
So I leave the house later than the original Amatsuki Suzuna.
Opening the front door, the morning sun streamed in—
“Good morning, Amatsuki Suzuna. You’re quite late this morning.”
—Kokona-chan was there to greet me.
◇◇◇
“…Um.”
How did this happen?
I’m now walking to school with Kokona-chan.
And Kokona-chan beside me is radiating an unsettling aura.
I’ve never seen her act like this before.
Normally, she’s a brocon who’s always attached to Shindo-kun.
So why is she here alone, and moreover, why did she come to Amatsuki Suzuna’s house?
I don’t understand.
“What’s with that sleepy face? Did you oversleep, is that why you’re late today?”
“Well, I am sleepy, but I didn’t oversleep. I intended to leave around this time.”
“You always come to wake up Onii-chan, but you didn’t come yesterday or today, did you? What are you playing at?”
“What am I playing at…?”
Should I just tell her that I’m rooting for the Kokona-chan route?
“Isn’t being devoted to Onii-chan Amatsuki Suzuna’s only redeeming quality? So what in the world happened to make you change like this?”
It seems Kokona-chan is suspicious of my sudden change in attitude.
I think she should be happy that a rival is out of the picture, but why is she so indignant?
I really don’t understand.
Anyway, should I just declare that I’m no longer a love rival?
“I’m not going to wake Shindo-kun up in the morning anymore, and I’m not making him lunch either. I’ll leave taking care of him to you, Kokona-chan.”
“…Are you serious?”
“Yes, I’m serious.”
Kokona-chan’s gaze pierced me.
“So you’re giving up on Onii-chan?”
“Yeah, I guess you could say that.”
“Aren’t you being a little too nonchalant about it?”
“…Am I?”
The intensity of Kokona-chan’s presence beside me continued to increase.
It’s amazing how she can exude so much energy in the morning. Youth is wonderful.
We’re only a year apart, but I couldn’t imitate her.
“I’m not stupid. I know you’ve liked Onii-chan since we were little. It’s annoying, but I thought your feelings were genuine…”
Kokona-chan’s shoulders trembled.
I don’t know what kind of emotions she’s experiencing.
“Were your feelings… just that much?!”
“Well, yeah.”
“That’s why I’m saying you’re being too nonchalant!!”
Kokona-chan bared her fangs at me.
Ah, what should I do?
I don’t want to make Kokona-chan angry.
In fact, I want to make her happy, but no matter what I say, she gets angry.
“Ah… how should I put it? I’ve come to realize my own limitations? I finally understood that Shindo-kun is out of my league.”
“It’s not like Onii-chan is that great of a catch, he’s actually a good-for-nothing!!”
Ah, so we agree on that.
Then, should I approach it from that angle?
“Yeah, he’s a bit… irresponsible. I’m not a fan of that.”
“Don’t badmouth Onii-chan! That’s what’s cute about him!!”
Eh…
I don’t get it anymore…
This conversation is impossible.
I can’t keep up with such a complicated conversation with my poor communication skills.
“So, what exactly don’t you like, Kokona-chan?”
“You, Amatsuki Suzuna, were the one who liked Onii-chan even with all his flaws! It’s annoying… extremely annoying, but I acknowledged that about you!!”
Ah…
Is this the “love rivals are also understanding confidantes” type of conversation?
I don’t understand that kind of thing at all…
Love rivals are definitely enemies.
Having the same crush just leads to jealousy, and I definitely don’t want to share my feelings.
…Ah, I’m sorry.
This is just the delusional ramblings of an introvert who’s never had a boyfriend.
It’s all manga and novel fantasies. I have no real-life experience.
“…How should I put it? I realized there’s a girl who’s better suited for him, someone more… encompassing, so I thought I should step aside.”
Whatever.
I just want her to understand so she’ll leave me alone.
I don’t want Kokona-chan to act out of character on top of Hinase-san and me already deviating wildly from the original story.
Just stick to the heroine route, please.
“…Hah?! Who are you talking about?!”
“…Well, that would be…”
I couldn’t say it was her.
Kokona-chan’s feelings for Shindo-kun are supposed to be her top secret.
Even though it’s obvious to everyone that she’s head over heels for him, the siblings themselves are oblivious.
Obliviousness must be genetic.
That’s why I hesitate to name her directly.
“Good morniiing! Amatsuki-san, you’re too slow to reply! Being left on read really hurts, you know?”
“Wah…”
Just as I smelled a sweet fragrance from behind me, Hinase-san hugged me.
“Hey, Hinase-san, don’t cling to me.”
Even though we’re friends now, I don’t remember allowing her to get this close.
I peeled off Hinase-san’s arms, which were clinging to me affectionately.
“No, you have to atone for ignoring me.”
“I’m sorry for the late reply, but I’ve never heard of clinging as a form of atonement.”
Even so, Hinase-san continued to cling to me.
Like an amoeba, she slipped through my grasp and pressed against me.
I don’t understand why she’s doing this.
“Hinase Riri! What are you doing to Amatsuki Suzuna?!”
Kokona-chan, who was watching from the side, stared wide-eyed.
Of course she would. Even I would react that way if I saw two people with such contrasting appearances interacting like this.
“Amatsuki-san, who is this?”
“She’s Shindo-kun’s younger sister, Shindo Kokona-chan.”
“Ahh, I see.”
Hinase-san nodded and smiled at Kokona-chan.
…That smile seemed somewhat forced, but it must be my imagination.
“Good morning, Kokona. As you can see, I’m greeting my friend, Amatsuki-san.”
“Friend…? You’re friends with Amatsuki Suzuna?”
“Yeah, we hang out together.”
“W-Wait… the eternally lonely Amatsuki Suzuna has a friend…? And it’s… Hinase Riri…?”
Even though Kokona-chan is new to the school, word of Hinase-san must have reached her. She seemed surprised by the stark contrast between the two of us.
“…!! ‘I realized there’s a girl who’s better suited for him, someone more encompassing…’ Amatsuki Suzuna, is that what you meant?!”
Hm…?
Why did Kokona-chan suddenly seem convinced?
The timing is strange.
“You two are going to become even closer from now on, right?”
“Hinase-san, your face is too close.”
“You two…!!”
Hinase-san is clinging to me, and Kokona-chan is angry.
This morning is too high-calorie.
A peaceful morning feels so far away. It’s painful.
------------------ 
11 The Childhood Friend’s Risk Hedge
…This isn’t good, is it?
It happened during lunch break.
Watching the tragedy unfolding before me, I started to feel anxious.
“What’s wrong, Onii-chan? You’ve stopped eating.”
“…N-No… It’s just… the taste…”
A seemingly harmonious lunchtime for the Shindo siblings.
The younger sister prepares lunch, and the older brother eats it.
It should be a heartwarming scene, but how did it end up with such an unsettling atmosphere?
“The taste, what?”
Kokona-chan’s tone sharpened at Shindo-kun’s vague response.
Her tone sounded angry, and Shindo-kun flinched and recoiled.
“…No, it’s so delicious that… it’s a waste to eat…”
“I see, that’s good then. Which part was the most delicious? Tell me so I can keep it in mind for the future.”
“Ah, well… this grilled squid is quite…”
“That’s tamagoyaki.”
“?! Wh-Why does this egg have such a springy texture…?!”
“Huh? Onii-chan, what was that?”
“Ah, no… It’s so delicious, I thought it was grilled squid!!”
“Onii-chan, were you always such a fan of squid…?”
Listening to them gave me a headache.
How can you mistake an egg for squid…?
Is there something wrong with Shindo-kun’s taste buds, or is Kokona-chan’s cooking from another dimension…?
Well, I think it’s the latter…
“S-Suzuna…”
Shindo-kun turned to me with puppy-dog eyes.
Unable to bear it, I stuffed my face with my sandwich and looked out the window to escape.
“Hey! Amatsuki Suzuna isn’t making lunch anymore, so stop looking away and eat Kokona’s bento!”
“A-Ah…”
“Do you have a problem with that?!”
“No, ma’am!!”
Initially, I thought this situation would be fine because Kokona-chan’s cooking skills would improve.
But I overlooked a crucial point.
In the original story, there’s a scene where Kokona-chan challenges Amatsuki Suzuna to a bento battle.
However, Shindo-kun always chooses Amatsuki Suzuna’s bento.
From that defeat, Kokona-chan studies Amatsuki Suzuna’s bento and her cooking skills improve.
In other words, Kokona-chan’s cooking skills improve because she has Amatsuki Suzuna as a rival.
But what about now?
“Ah, these asparagus are more crisp and delicious than usual.”
…Aren’t they just undercooked?
“That’s broccoli.”
W-Wrong again?!
“?! W-Why is it just the core…? Where’s the fluffy part…?!”
“Eh, was it bad…?”
“No, it’s like haute cuisine!! I’m in awe of your originality!!”
“Oh, good. I’m glad.”
Yes, she’s on her own now.
Since Shindo-kun can’t refuse Kokona-chan and continues to eat her cooking, she’s not getting any proper feedback.
…At this rate, I can’t imagine their relationship improving or her affection level increasing.
Two heroines have already dropped out, and I want to avoid any more casualties.
◇◇◇
There’s a reason why I need Shindo Minato, the protagonist of this game, to end up with one of the heroines.
An ending where he doesn’t end up with a heroine means a bad ending for a dating sim.
In that case, the story is forced into an ending where Amatsuki Suzuna watches over the lonely Shindo Minato.
Of course, since it’s basically a bad ending, there’s no depiction of them becoming lovers or anything.
However, Amatsuki Suzuna, who has feelings for him, is the only one left in the end.
Even though it’s not depicted in the story, it wouldn’t be strange if they ended up in a relationship afterwards.
Anyway, I don’t have any feelings for him, so I don’t want to be forced into that kind of situation.
“…That being said, this is troublesome.”
I finished my sandwich and stood up.
I needed to come up with a plan.
I went out into the hallway to think things over alone.
I headed towards the music room at the back of the school building, where there were fewer people.
The number of people gradually dwindled.
“Amatsuki-san!”
…A cheerful voice called out from behind me.
“Hinase-san… did you… follow me?”
I can’t imagine Hinase-san being here for any other reason.
“No, it’s a coincidence.”
Her eyes darted around.
She definitely followed me.
“I’m trying to think about something.”
“Then let’s talk!”
“Did you… hear me?”
“You hate it when we talk in the classroom. It’s fine here.”
Saying that, Hinase-san linked her arm with mine.
“H-Hey… Hinase-san, what if someone sees us?!”
“It’s fine, we’re just friends.”
No, it’s not that, it’s our social standing, how it looks…
As if sensing my impending objection, Hinase-san forcefully pulled me along.
“Okay, I get it. We just can’t be seen.”
She opened the music room door.
It was empty inside.
“See? This is fine, right?”
“…Not really.”
“It’s not bad either, right? So what were you thinking about?”
“…It’s nothing to do with you, Hinase-san, so there’s no point in telling you.”
“Then it’ll be easier for you to talk about it casually. Sometimes it’s better to talk things out than to think in silence.”
…She was forceful just a moment ago, and now she’s saying something sensible.
Hearing her say that, it sounded strangely convincing.
I’m weak against Hinase-san at times like these.
“…Do you know that Kokona-chan is making lunch for Shindo-kun?”
“Yeah, I saw you staring at them earlier, Amatsuki-san. So I kind of figured it out.”
…Huh?
That’s a strange sequence of events. Why does she know about it through me…?
Well, it’s not something worth questioning.
“Kokona-chan doesn’t seem very good at cooking, and Shindo-kun seems to be struggling eating it.”
“Is that so? Does that bother you?”
“Well, yeah… Kokona-chan is working so hard to make it, so he can’t say anything bad, but I feel bad for him having to eat it.”
Actually, I’m just worried about managing his affection level.
“Are you that close to the Shindo siblings, Amatsuki-san?”
“Well, yeah… I’m childhood friends with the older brother.”
“Hee… So you feel bad for him, huh?”
Hinase-san’s tone of voice seemed unusually low.
…C-Could it be?
Is she starting to develop feelings for Shindo-kun as a heroine?
“Hinase-san, are you interested in Shindo-kun?”
“Eh? No, he’s just a classmate. I haven’t really talked to him much.”
“…But are you a little interested?”
“? Not particularly.”
…It’s no use.
It’s probably my fault for making her skip the event.
It’s going to be extremely difficult to get her interested in him from here.
Then, I’ll just have to rely on Kokona-chan.
“Shindo, what did you do for lunch before? Couldn’t you just go back to how things were before Kokona started school?”
“…No, absolutely not.”
Going back to how things were means Amatsuki Suzuna making lunch.
Then the bento battle with Amatsuki Suzuna would begin, and Kokona-chan’s cooking level would rise.
But at the same time, there’s a risk of increasing my affection level with him. That’s not what I want.
“Why?”
“I used to make his lunch. I don’t want to do that anymore.”
“…Huh?”
“Eh?”
Suddenly, Hinase-san’s voice sharpened.
It was the first time I’d heard such a tone from her. It was scary.
“You… made lunch for Shindo, Amatsuki-san?”
“Uh, yeah… but…”
Hinase-san leaned closer.
But it wasn’t her usual playful manner. It was an unspoken pressure, a sharp intensity.
I instinctively recoiled.
“…Ah, sorry, sorry. I was just surprised. You did that much for him, Amatsuki-san.”
Hinase-san smiled apologetically, her voice returning to its usual brightness.
The stark contrast only highlighted how different she was just a moment ago.
“Y-Yeah… I’m not doing it anymore, though.”
“Is that so? Did something happen between you and Shindo?”
No, something happened with me, the new Amatsuki Suzuna, not with him.
“Well, Kokona-chan is making his lunch now… and I didn’t want to cook anymore…”
“But you still care about him, don’t you, Shindo?”
Hinase-san’s voice hardened again, though not as much as before.
“Well… yeah. He’s my childhood friend.”
Or rather, he’s the protagonist, so I’m just scared of when his clutches will reach me.
“I see, your childhood friend. …That makes sense.”
Hinase-san nodded several times.
But it seemed like she was forcing herself to accept something she didn’t quite understand.
“I thought you were trying to keep your distance from people, Amatsuki-san, but is it different with a childhood friend?”
“Uh… well, I guess so.”
Strictly speaking, it was the original Amatsuki Suzuna who maintained that childhood friend distance, not me, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
But I can’t erase the actions she took. That past remains.
“Then, it’s okay if I treat you like a friend too, right?”
Hinase-san moved closer again.
With the wall behind me, I had nowhere to go.
“What do you mean by… treating me like a friend…?”
“Names.”
“Names…?”
Hinase-san’s face was close.
Close enough to feel her breath.
“Let’s call each other by our first names. It’s too formal to always use last names and honorifics.”
“Eh…”
“It’s unfair that only Shindo gets that childhood friend level of closeness. Treat me like a friend too.”
Hinase-san’s beautiful almond-shaped eyes.
I’m still not used to them focusing solely on me.
------------------ 
12 Distance of the Heart
Exchanging contact information, spending time after school together.
Not only that, but calling each other by our first names.
That’s what Hinase-san calls “friend distance.”
That might be true, but…
“Calling each other by our first names…?”
“Yeah, that’s natural, right?”
Me calling Hinase-san “Riri…”
Just imagining it felt strange.
It seemed too familiar, too presumptuous.
“I don’t mind if you call me by my first name, Hinase-san…”
“You won’t call me Riri?”
Without missing a beat, Hinase-san called me by my first name.
It was just that, yet it felt like the distance between us suddenly changed.
But that distance felt uncomfortable.
Too close, like how Hinase-san was pressing close to me now.
“I… I feel like it’s a bit different…”
“What’s different?”
It’s one thing if she initiates it, but it’s different if I have to do it.
“I… feel resistant to calling you by your first name, Hinase-san. Like we’re not that close yet…”
“Making lunch for your childhood friend is way more intimate than that. Compared to that, calling each other by our first names as friends is normal.”
Hinase-san kept bringing up Shindo-kun.
That’s also when her demeanor changed.
I don’t understand.
Where’s the casual consultation she promised? This is different.
“Come on, say it. It’s one-sided if it’s just me.”
Hinase-san’s arm reached past my face and planted her hand on the wall.
It was as if I was trapped by her.
It felt suffocating, like my freedom was being taken away.
“Why are you so insistent? I think it’s fine to call each other whatever’s easiest.”
“If I leave you alone, Suzuna, you’ll stay like that forever, right? That’s why I’m trying to get closer.”
“I don’t understand… I don’t think you need to try so hard to get closer.”
“You know, distance doesn’t shrink unless you take a step forward yourself.”
Hinase-san said something that seemed obvious, yet slightly strange, with a serious expression.
“But you’re already close, Hinase-san. If I get any closer, we’ll be stuck together.”
“That’s fine.”
“That’s weird, that’s definitely weird.”
“What constitutes ‘close’ depends on the relationship.”
I really didn’t understand.
So she’s saying that this distance isn’t considered close for friends?
Is she saying this distance is normal?
If so, I really think making friends is difficult.
“Or are you saying you don’t feel anything for me, Suzuna?”
…That’s a low blow.
She was speaking so forcefully just now, and suddenly she’s using such a weak voice.
Being looked at with such an anxious expression makes me feel bad.
I don’t want to make her feel that way.
It’s as if I’m the one doing something wrong.
“…Fine.”
“Then call me by my name.”
Postponing it was not an option.
Hinase-san immediately demanded an answer.
That speed felt like she was rushing me.
I took a moment to compose myself, to steady my breath.
“…Riri…-san.”
“…You don’t need the ‘-san.’”
“I called you by your name.”
“But you don’t need the ‘-san.’”
“You didn’t say that.”
“Well, it’s in the way. It’s like we’re still strangers.”
Hinase-san is selfish.
I worked hard to do what she asked, and now she’s saying it’s not good enough.
“Then forget it. It’s fine if we’re strangers, Hinase-san.”
“Ah, come on, don’t get sulky.”
“I tried, I really tried.”
“Then try a little harder. You’re almost there.”
…It seemed like Hinase-san wouldn’t let me go unless I called her by her first name.
Is this what friendship is about, demanding more and more?
“Riri-chan.”
“…You don’t need the ‘-chan’—”
“Hinase-san, I’m leaving.”
I couldn’t take it anymore.
I put all my strength into pushing Hinase-san’s arm away.
“Ah! Okay, okay! ‘-chan’ is fine! Just call me by my name?!”
“…Fine.”
She finally relented… Riri-chan released me.
This is how she closes the distance between us.
It was within acceptable limits, but now she’s demanding the same from me.
I don’t feel like I have a good grasp of what “friend distance” is.
◇◇◇
“Ehehe…”
Leaving the music room, Riri-chan was in high spirits.
The tense atmosphere from just a moment ago seemed like a lie.
“Why are you so happy?”
“Because you called me by my name, Suzuna.”
“Is that all?”
“That’s all.”
…Well, the effort required to say the words is the same.
If she’s this happy about it, then maybe it was worth the effort.
“What about you, Suzuna? No, wait.”
“…I—”
I don’t dislike it.
I was resistant to being called “Suzuna” by Shindo-kun, but I don’t feel that resistance with Riri-chan.
I think that’s the answer.
“…It’s… okay, I guess.”
“Eh~ Be happy about it!”
What Riri-chan says is difficult.
Everyone feels differently, so I wish she’d forgive me for having slightly different reactions.
“And we didn’t even get to my problem. Somehow we ended up talking about calling each other by our first names.”
“A-Ahaha… that’s true.”
Riri-chan scratched her cheek, looking embarrassed.
She probably felt awkward since she was the one who brought it up.
“Ah, I have an idea. Why don’t you teach Kokona how to cook directly?”
Riri-chan’s voice brightened as if a lightbulb went off.
She definitely just thought of that. She must have completely forgotten about my problem until now.
…But I’ll let it slide since she’s thinking about it now.
“Teach her how to cook, huh…”
Certainly, if I do that, there’s no involvement from Shindo-kun, so my affection level with him won’t increase.
And if Kokona-chan’s cooking improves, her affection level will probably go up.
It seemed like a decent plan.
“…But there’s a problem with that.”
“What?”
“Who’s going to teach her?”
Riri-chan widened her eyes in surprise.
“Well, you, Suzuna.”
“…Seriously?”
“Obviously. Who else would do it?”
Well, she’s right, but…
Even though I share her memories, I’ve never actually cooked before, so I’m not sure I can.
“…How about… you teach her, Riri-chan?”
Hinase Riri has a domestic side.
Despite being a gal, she has the skills to handle all sorts of housework.
“No way. Why should I teach a classmate I barely know, especially his younger sister, how to cook? She wouldn’t want that either.”
She had a point.
I’d refuse too if I were in her shoes.
“Then how about I film myself cooking and show her the video?”
“No… that’s not going to work either.”
Riri-chan looked exasperated.
“Eh?”
“If that worked, she’d already be good at cooking. You have to teach her directly.”
“…How about a video call?”
“Why does it always have to be through a screen? I said directly.”
That means I have to communicate with Kokona-chan directly.
“…That’s a pain.”
Amatsuki Suzuna isn’t well-liked, so it seems tiring.
And teaching someone something means I have to talk a lot.
Doing that face-to-face is quite stressful.
“Do you want to do it, or do you not want to do it?”
“I don’t want to.”
“…You’re a strange one, Suzuna.”
“Am I?”
“You suddenly stopped making lunch for Shindo, you seem worried that Kokona started making it, but you don’t want to teach her? That’s pretty strange.”
Well, she’s right.
Is this the original Amatsuki Suzuna’s fault, or is it mine for being reborn as her?
It’s a shame I can’t explain it.
“It’s strange that you became friends with someone as incomprehensible as me, Riri-chan.”
I replied to Riri-chan sarcastically, venting my frustration.
“Uehehe… of course.”
…But she didn’t seem to mind.
Instead, every time I called her “Riri-chan,” her face softened into a smile.

T/N:
I’ve decided to maintain honorifics like the following ones:
Well, the common ones that appear in manga or anime, I already edited the previous chapters.
13 Under a Spell
“Teach Kokona how to cook? You, Amatsuki Suzuna?”
After school, I approached Kokona-chan, who had come to pick up Shindo-kun.
Fortunately, Shindo-kun had been called out by a teacher and had left the classroom, so he didn’t overhear our conversation.
“Y-Yeah. I was thinking…”
“It’s unnecessary.”
“…Eh?”
An immediate rejection.
And one laced with clear irritation.
Seeing such a disgusted expression almost broke my spirit.
“Frankly, it’s none of your business. There’s no reason for me to learn from you.”
“Well, I used to make lunch for Shindo-kun, so I thought I could teach you some of the things he likes…”
Fortunately, or unfortunately, I still have Amatsuki Suzuna’s memories, so I remember the dishes she used to make for Shindo-kun.
I know the seasonings and portions, so it shouldn’t be a bad deal for Kokona-chan.
“What’s that supposed to mean? You gave Onii-chan up to Kokona, and now you’re trying to interfere?”
“No, that’s not what I meant…”
I’m trying to be helpful…
“Or what? You were going to admit defeat, but you can’t really give up, so you’re trying to leave some trace of Amatsuki Suzuna with Onii-chan by teaching Kokona your cooking?”
“Uh, um…”
Isn’t her imagination a bit… overactive?
I don’t feel that way at all, but Kokona-chan seemed extremely displeased, piling on negative assumptions.
“That’s creepy. You’d go that far to leave your mark on Onii-chan? Just how underhanded are you?”
U-Underhanded… I’m aware of that side of me, but I’m not being like that now…
“Besides, Kokona’s cooking is definitely more delicious than yours. Why would I need to learn from you?”
“W-Well… maybe… depending on the dish, mine might be more to Shindo-kun’s liking…”
My voice trailed off as Kokona-chan’s expression turned demonic.
“Kokona’s cooking is definitely more to Onii-chan’s liking than yours! Don’t say such weird things!”
“S-Sorry!”
W-Wait a minute…
I’m her senpai, right…? Why am I being scolded like this?
Even if you’re trying to be helpful, there are times when it’s unwanted.
But this is a bit much…
“More than anything, I don’t want you interfering with Onii-chan’s matters anymore!”
“I’m not trying to interfere…”
“You’re interfering way too much! Just because you’re feeling a little confident, don’t act all high and mighty with me!”
C-Confident…?
I’m not confident at all.
But she didn’t give me a chance to argue.
“Forget it, Onii-chan’s at the staff room, right?! Kokona’s going to pick him up!!”
Snorting, Kokona-chan stormed out of the classroom.
Kokona-chan’s complete refusal to listen to me painted a clear picture of a bad ending.
◇◇◇
“—So, you’re like this because she rejected you?”
“…Yeah.”
Completely heartbroken, I couldn’t move from my seat.
Having lost the will to go home, I slumped over my desk, my vision sinking into darkness.
It was after the sounds of the crowd faded that Riri-chan spoke to me.
“But do you really have to be this depressed just because she rejected you?”
Riri-chan crouched down and peered at my face, turned sideways on the desk.
Her brown hair, illuminated by the setting sun, was dyed crimson, reflecting the light with a glossy sheen.
“I worked up the courage, you know… so being rejected with such a disgusted expression…”
“You’re so sensitive.”
Instead of comforting me, Riri-chan offered a harsh remark.
“Don’t say anything more, you’re kicking me while I’m down…”
“Ah, sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”
I know she didn’t mean any harm, but it still hurt someone with a fragile mentality like mine.
Even if I know it, I can’t help it, because I am weak.
“What are you doing here, Riri-chan? Shouldn’t you be going home with your cheerful friends?”
“I’m waiting for you so we can go home together.”
“The friends I’m talking about are the sparkly girls just like you. I’m introverted and gloomy, so don’t lump me in with them.”
“Wow… Suzuna, you really get like this when you’re feeling down…”
Riri-chan chuckled, looking troubled, and stood up again.
Her skirt swirled in front of me.
Since her skirt is short, her bare thighs were exposed.
I thought her legs, not too thin, with just the right amount of flesh, were beautiful.
Being this close, I could see the texture of her skin, which made me think so even more.
“There, there.”
I felt a warm touch on the top of my head.
“Eh… what are you doing?”
“I’m patting your head. It’s sad that you tried so hard but weren’t rewarded.”
Riri-chan was stroking my head.
Her hand glided over my hair repeatedly.
“Pity…?”
Or was this, like Shindo-kun, some kind of self-serving reward…?
“I just want you to feel better, Suzuna, that’s all.”
“That’s all…?”
“Yeah, sometimes things don’t go your way in life. But doesn’t it make you feel a little better to have someone by your side like this?”
What happened, happened.
But Riri-chan’s hand certainly helped to distract me from it.
Her touch was gentle and comforting.
When Shindo-kun reached out to pat my head, I instinctively dodged.
Because I didn’t want to be touched by him.
But I don’t feel that aversion towards Riri-chan.
In fact, I realized that my heart was gradually feeling lighter.
“…Maybe it does.”
“See? You were so brave, Suzuna. It’s okay to be rewarded a little.”
Her voice was gentle, directed solely at me.
Only Riri-chan seemed to understand my pain.
It was just that, yet it soothed me so much.
“You’re amazing, Riri-chan. Can you use magic to heal emotional wounds?”
I know there’s no such thing, but Riri-chan’s presence made me wish there was.
“I can.”
“…Really?”
I didn’t expect her to agree, since I said it as a joke.
“Yeah, but only for you, Suzuna.”
“Only for me…”
“That’s right. I can’t use it on anyone else, and I don’t want to.”
“I see…”
Those words were probably her way of showing support.
And I appreciated it.
“So, forgive yourself, Suzuna. You did your best today, and that’s enough.”
“Even though it didn’t work out, it’s okay?”
“It’s fine.”
“I see…”
“Yeah.”
In the after-school classroom, Riri-chan stroked my head.
The warmth of her hand remained more vivid than the fading sunset outside the window.
The weight in my heart gradually lifted. That was the magic she cast on me.
------------------ 
14 A Homemade Meal for Onii-chan
“Sigh…”
I couldn’t help but let out a weak sigh.
Even though Riri-chan’s encouragement temporarily lifted my spirits, morning still came.
As long as Kokona-chan’s bento problem remained unsolved, my future as a mob character was uncertain.
I needed to take swift action.
I stood in the kitchen, holding a knife, for the first time in what felt like forever.
◇◇◇
Lunch break.
A time for everyone to relax and unwind.
But my tension mounted.
Because she was coming.
“Onii-chan! I brought your lunch!”
“O-Oh…”
Shindo-kun’s face stiffened at Kokona-chan’s appearance.
I couldn’t let this tragedy continue.
I stood up from my seat.
Before Kokona-chan could approach Shindo-kun, I walked towards her.
“Kokona-chan.”
“…What do you want, Amatsuki Suzuna?”
She made no attempt to hide her “Why are you talking to me?” attitude.
I wanted to run from her sharp gaze, but I stood my ground.
I held up the lunch bag I had made this morning.
“Let’s eat lunch together.”
“…Huh?”
This time, her voice was filled with genuine surprise.
She probably never imagined I’d invite her.
“Let’s go to the courtyard.”
“No, wait, I have to give Onii-chan his lunch…”
“No, we’re eating that lunch together.”
“Huh? Why all of a sudden—”
This conversation was going nowhere.
I took Kokona-chan’s arm and started walking.
“H-Hey, let go of me. Amatsuki Suzuna…!”
“I won’t. We’re eating lunch together.”
“I-I don’t understand…!”
“Yeah, Suzuna, what about my lunch?”
Shindo-kun, who had been watching from the sidelines, chimed in.
Seriously, why are you still trying to eat Kokona-chan’s lunch at this point…?
Can’t you tell I’m trying to help you?
“See! Onii-chan’s saying it too!”
“Fine, here, Shindo-kun.”
I placed a sandwich on Shindo-kun’s desk.
I had forgotten that I made my own lunch and bought a sandwich out of habit.
It was a coincidence, but the timing was perfect.
“…Is this all?”
I couldn’t believe Shindo-kun’s look, as if to say, “This isn’t enough.”
What more does he want?
The perpetually pampered protagonist is so demanding.
“If it’s not enough, go buy something at the school store. …Come on, Kokona-chan, let’s go.”
“H-Hey, Amatsuki Suzuna…!!”
I left the classroom with Kokona-chan.
◇◇◇
In the courtyard.
Spring can be chilly, but fortunately, the weather was nice today.
The sun was out, the temperature was warm, and the wind was gentle.
It was comfortable enough to be outside in our uniforms.
“Let’s sit over there.”
I pointed to a bench in the shade and led her there.
As I sat down, Kokona-chan looked down at me with a dissatisfied expression.
“What… are you playing at?”
“I told you, we’re eating lunch together.”
“I’m asking what your goal is.”
“It’s for Shindo-kun’s… no, for your benefit, Kokona-chan.”
I returned her gaze, not flinching from her suspicious eyes.
“If I’m lying, you can leave right away.”
Perhaps convinced by my sincerity, Kokona-chan sat down next to me with a sigh.
“Fine. Then open your lunch.”
“Okay…”
Kokona-chan opened her bento box.
Half of it was filled with onigiri, the other half with side dishes.
A pale, yellow-less tamagoyaki, unevenly colored broccoli, and a mushy hamburger.
The contents were quite chaotic.
It’s a character trait, but isn’t this a bit much…?
“This is mine.”
I opened my lunch box in the same way.
“Amatsuki Suzuna, that’s…”
“Yeah, I made the same thing.”
I had already researched Kokona-chan’s limited cooking repertoire through the game.
Using that knowledge, I deliberately prepared the exact same dishes.
“…Amatsuki Suzuna. These… are the same?”
“Eh?”
Kokona-chan stared at my bento box as if it were some strange object.
“Don’t they look… kind of… bad?”
“Ah, well… the shape is… charming.”
“Isn’t the hamburger too lumpy?”
“Kneading is difficult, isn’t it?”
I’m just clumsy.
“Why are the onigiri so perfectly round?”
“Shaping them is difficult, isn’t it?”
I actually wanted to ask her how she managed to shape them into such perfect triangles.
“Amatsuki Suzuna… when did you become such a bad cook?”
“Ehehe…”
“It’s not funny… I don’t know what to say.”
It’s true.
I’m sharing Amatsuki Suzuna’s memories. There’s no doubt about that.
But the miscalculation was that I didn’t inherit her skills.
So my hands can’t keep up with what I want to do.
In fact, because I have Amatsuki Suzuna’s cooking memories, the gap between ideal and reality is even more stark.
The result is a vicious cycle where the more I cook, the more frustrated I get.
I already dislike cooking, and in this state, there’s no way the food would look presentable.
“I guess it’s like the yips.”
“Is that a thing with cooking?!”
Ah, they really are siblings.
I remember Shindo-kun reacting the same way.
“Well, well, the most important thing about cooking is the taste. As long as it tastes good, it’s fine.”
“…I can’t imagine someone who can’t even shape onigiri properly can make something taste good.”
I know that.
Or rather, I’m the one who wants to complain.
Normally, I think you’d retain some level of skill after being reborn.
But this Amatsuki Suzuna is almost entirely the same as me, except for the memories.
I think she could have been a little more accommodating.
“Just… eat it.”
I offered her the bento box.
Kokona-chan looked at it suspiciously.
“Is it cooked properly…?”
“It’s fine, I tasted it.”
“If you say so…”
Kokona-chan hesitantly picked up a piece of my hamburger with her chopsticks and brought it to her mouth.
She chewed cautiously, her eyes wary.
“How is it?”
“It’s… delicious.”
Exactly.
Even if it looks bad, that’s just the appearance.
Even a clumsy person like me can manage the seasoning, heat control, and other cooking processes.
The taste itself replicates Amatsuki Suzuna’s cooking. Probably.
“Can I have some of yours?”
“You’re supposed to ask…”
Without waiting for her to finish, I picked up a piece of tamagoyaki from Kokona-chan’s bento and ate it.
“Hmm… it’s a little overcooked. And Shindo-kun likes mayonnaise better than dressing on broccoli.”
“Wh-What…? Onii-chan always eats his salad with dressing.”
“Salad, yes. But he likes mayonnaise on cooked broccoli. He told me that before.”
When I was playing the game, I thought, “Who are you to complain about the condiments when you’re just eating what’s given to you?”
I never thought this knowledge would be useful in a situation like this.
“What? Are you trying to show off? You said you weren’t making lunch anymore.”
Appearance aside, Kokona-chan’s breathing grew ragged, sensing the difference in taste and my understanding of Shindo-kun’s preferences.
She was my rival, so the difference must be frustrating.
“No, that’s not it. I just wanted to give you some advice, Kokona-chan.”
I placed my hand on Kokona-chan’s shoulder.
“Don’t touch me!”
But my hand was immediately swatted away.
“Ouch…”
A jolt of pain shot through my hand.
“Ah, Amatsuki Suzuna… your hand…”
My hand had several band-aids on it.
I cut myself with the knife.
“It’s… nothing. I’m not good at cooking.”
“Why… would you go that far…?”
Her expression said she didn’t understand my actions.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it? I’m… rooting for you, Kokona-chan.”
“Seriously…?”
She was still half-doubtful, but my inexplicable actions lent some credibility to my words.
“Yeah, Shindo-kun needs you, Kokona-chan. I just want to help you.”
“…Why… all of a sudden? It’s like you’ve become a different person…”
The hostility in Kokona-chan’s tone softened slightly.
Her words were a bit unsettling, but she probably doesn’t suspect anything.
“Here, try another bite.”
“If you insist…”
Just as she was about to take a second bite—
“—Suzuna…? What’s going on here?”
““?!””
A sudden visitor.
Riri-chan stood behind us, smiling.
But her tone was completely different.
And judging by the tense atmosphere and her stiff smile, she wasn’t happy…
------------------ 
15 What It Means to Fall in Love
“Now then, I’d like an explanation for this, if you please.”
Riri-chan wore a forced smile I’d never seen before.
Scary, scary, scary…
It was clear that her outward appearance and inner feelings were at odds.
That’s what made it so terrifying.
I froze, bewildered.
“H-Hinase Riri?! What are you doing here all of a sudden?!”
However, Kokona-chan didn’t notice the subtle change in Riri-chan’s demeanor. She simply raised her voice in surprise.
Ah, I don’t think it’s a good idea to provoke her…
“Well, I saw two people leaving the classroom with bento boxes, and I got curious, and then I saw you two in the courtyard at this time of day? Sitting on a bench as if you were hiding, so I thought something was up, and… here I am.”
Her voice was unusually high-pitched, but the last part was strangely menacing.
Riri-chan, who was standing behind us, moved around to stand in front of us.
In contrast to the smile on her lips, her eyes, looking down at us, were devoid of emotion.
W-What is this…? I don’t think we did anything wrong…
“It doesn’t make sense for you to follow us and then act like this. In the first place, Amatsuki Suzuna is the one who brought me here. If you have something to say, say it to her.”
“…You’re right. You can explain this, can’t you, Suzuna?”
“Uh, um…”
Riri-chan should be the one who understands the situation best…
So why is she putting so much pressure on me?
I’ve never felt such unspoken pressure before.
“I was rejected when I asked you to eat lunch with me, Suzuna. But it’s fine with her…?”
“Huh…?”
I couldn’t quite keep up.
I understand what she’s saying, but her words and her attitude don’t match.
“And you’re even sharing your bentos… what’s that about? I wasn’t told anything about this.”
“W-Wait, Riri-chan. I told you I wanted to teach Kokona-chan how to cook…”
It was Riri-chan who listened to my worries after school and patted my head.
So why is she acting like this?
“I heard you. You said you wanted to teach her how to cook.”
“Th-Then…”
“But I didn’t hear a single word about making bentos and eating together.”
Eh… wait. Is that what this is about?
Well, wanting to teach someone how to cook and sharing bentos aren’t exactly the same thing.
But she should understand that it’s a related activity.
Especially Riri-chan, who knows the whole story.
“I thought it would be easier to start by having her try my cooking, rather than suddenly teaching her. It’s more persuasive…”
“I didn’t hear anything about that. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“It’s not like I didn’t tell…”
“You’re keeping secrets from me, Suzuna.”
Eh…?
Is this… a secret…?
Even if I was hiding it, why is Riri-chan being so confrontational?
Did I do something that bad?
“…Kokona, what are we even watching here?”
Kokona-chan sighed, looking fed up.
Even I don’t fully understand what’s going on, so it must be even more confusing for her as a third party.
“Actually, you’re the cause of this.”
Riri-chan shifted her target to Kokona-chan.
“…What are you talking about?”
But Kokona-chan didn’t flinch.
“If you could cook properly from the start, Suzuna wouldn’t have needed to go to all this trouble.”
“…I didn’t ask her to. And it has nothing to do with Hinase Riri anyway.”
Kokona-chan turned away, snorting.
But Riri-chan wasn’t fazed by her rejection.
“Suzuna doesn’t even want to cook, but she made this bento for you because she wants you to improve.”
“…I understand that. I intend to learn.”
Oh…
Kokona-chan’s attitude towards cooking has changed.
Good, there’s hope for the Kokona route.
“Think about how much effort Suzuna put in to make you a homemade meal… how envia— no, I mean, appreciate her feelings.”
“…Did you just say something weird?”
“I didn’t.”
Kokona-chan took a breath.
“I still don’t understand why Amatsuki Suzuna would do this for Kokona—”
Kokona-chan looked at me, sitting next to her.
“—You liked Onii-chan, didn’t you? Why did you give up so easily?”
She asked for an answer.
“W-Wait a minute! Seriously, what’s that about?!”
…The one who cut in with a loud voice was Riri-chan.
“…Hinase Riri, you’ve been noisy this whole time.”
“No, no, this is the first time I’ve heard that Suzuna has someone she likes!”
Past tense, you know.
But I guess I have no choice but to answer honestly now.
“…I, Amatsuki Suzuna, was enabling Shindo-kun. But I decided to stop.”
“…Why?”
That answer was equivalent to denying the existence of the former Amatsuki Suzuna.
Kokona-chan, understanding this, questioned the meaning.
“I think by doing that, I, Amatsuki Suzuna, was also being enabled. Being relied on makes me feel like I have a reason to exist.”
“…And you threw that away?”
“Yes. Because I, Yukitsuki Mashiro, don’t think that’s the same as standing on my own two feet. I don’t want a one-sided relationship where one person relies on the other. I want to find someone who will support me, and who I can support in return.”
“…I see. So that’s your answer.”
Kokona-chan looked away from me.
“W-Wait a minute! I’m still processing this. Suzuna, you liked Shindo and made him lunch every day?”
“Apparently, that’s in the past. Good for you, Hinase Riri.”
Kokona-chan stood up from the bench, brushed past the bewildered Riri-chan, and returned to the school building.
…Well, her problem should be resolved now.
The one who’s troubled now is the heroine in front of me.
“Hey. Suzuna, the bento thing, and having someone you like… this is the first time I’m hearing about this.”
…She was starting to sound angry.
I wonder why.
“Uh, um… I came up with the bento idea last night, and Shindo-kun is… in the past…”
“That’s not good enough! Explain properly!”
“But… there’s nothing more to explain…”
Lunch break was too short to explain things in a way that would satisfy Riri-chan.
◇◇◇
The next day, during lunch break.
I felt lighthearted today.
Because Kokona-chan will now improve her cooking skills and progress down the Shindo-kun route.
This practically guarantees my life as a mob character.
I can finally enjoy a peaceful life without any worries.
—Clatter
The door opened, and Kokona-chan appeared.
She was holding a lunch bag.
“K-Kokona… you made one again today?”
“Yeah, here.”
Don’t worry, Shindo-kun.
Kokona-chan’s cooking skills will improve dramatically from now on.
You can finally say goodbye to depressing lunch breaks.
“Kokona, this…”
Fufu, is it already working?
I heard Shindo-kun’s surprised voice.
Pretending not to notice, I opened my sandwich wrapper, as usual.
“Here, Amatsuki Suzuna.”
—Thud
A slightly heavy sound echoed on my desk.
For a moment, I doubted my own eyes.
“…Excuse me?”
Kokona-chan placed a lunch bag on my desk.
Confused, I looked up at her.
“It’s lunch. You’re not cooking anymore, right?”
“Eh… why… me…?”
“You’re helping me improve my cooking, aren’t you? Then take responsibility until the end.”
…Eh, what is this?
Kokona-chan is giving Amatsuki Suzuna a bento…?
Ah, I don’t understand.
I don’t know this. I don’t know this route.
“But I have a sandwich…”
“You’ll be malnourished if you only eat that.”
W-Why is she worried about me…?
Aren’t Shindo Kokona and Amatsuki Suzuna supposed to be rivals…?
“H-Hey, Kokona… then how do you explain this?”
Shindo-kun’s strained voice reached my ears.
What was placed on his desk wasn’t a bento box, but a sandwich.
“Kokona’s not making lunch for Onii-chan anymore. Prepare your own from now on.”
“W-What?!”
“Kokona thought about it too. Until now, I’ve been desperate for Onii-chan to acknowledge me, but I think it’s okay now. Both Onii-chan and Kokona should become more independent—”
Wait a minute.
I-It might be my imagination, but…
That sounds similar to what I said yesterday…
“—You think so too, don’t you, Amatsuki Suzuna?”
And then, Kokona-chan winked at me, making sure only I could see it.
“Y-Yes, I do…”
…Oh no.
Another heroine has turned her back on the protagonist.
What’s going on with this game?
Someone, please announce the title.

16 A Bento Box Filled with Feelings
“Well, well, Suzuna-san. What’s the meaning of this?”
“Ah, yes…”
I was sitting on a bench in the courtyard… or rather, I was made to sit.
On my lap was a bento box Kokona-chan made for me.
And Riri-chan was standing over me, glaring.
Her brow was furrowed, and her expression was severe.
To understand how this happened, we need to go back about ten minutes.
◇◇◇
“Here, you can eat it. And don’t forget to tell me what you think.”
Kokona-chan placed the bento box on my desk and wouldn’t leave my side.
This was what she used to do to Shindo-kun until yesterday.
I couldn’t understand why I had become the target of her attention.
“Um… I just wanted you to improve your cooking for Shindo-kun’s sake…”
I certainly didn’t encourage her to improve her cooking skills for me.
“Kokona realized something.”
“Yes…?”
“Ever since we were little, Onii-chan has been Kokona’s ideal. I wanted him to acknowledge me. That’s why I was jealous of you, always being so close to him.”
“I see…”
What is this conversation?
“So, all this time, I’ve been desperately trying to keep Amatsuki Suzuna from taking Onii-chan away. It became an obsession from a young age.”
Well, obsession or whatever…
Why does she sound so philosophical?
“But you know, you made me realize something. That kind of thinking only holds me back… no, it even limits Onii-chan’s possibilities.”
“Huh…?”
I don’t remember talking about Shindo-kun’s possibilities.
“I’ve woken up. I was in love with the idea of being in love. I was using that as an excuse to push you away.”
Kokona-chan gave a self-deprecating smile.
Her expression seemed much more mature than her age, as if she had taken a step from girlhood to womanhood…
“K-Kokona-chan…? Let’s calm down, okay? You’re not making any sense.”
“Heh… I suppose the Kokona from yesterday would have thought the same.”
Ah, this is bad…
She’s entered some higher dimension.
She’s hearing my words, but not listening.
Her eyes are looking far away.
“Come on, just eat it. I worked hard on it.”
Kokona-chan urged me to eat.
But I was breaking out in a cold sweat.
I felt a sense of crisis, like I was deviating from the Kokona route.
But a more frightening problem emerged.
In the corner of my eye, I saw Riri-chan in the center of the classroom, smiling at me.
“(Should I go over there?)”
Even though she was mouthing the words silently, I could understand what she meant. And despite the smile, I could tell she was angry.
Perhaps my interpersonal skills have improved, or perhaps my understanding of Riri-chan has deepened.
Either way, it should be a good thing, but the timing was terrible, and I couldn’t be happy about it.
—Screech
I quickly stood up.
“Amatsuki Suzuna…?”
“I have something urgent to do…”
“Eh, what about my bento?”
“I-I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you later, I’m sorry, but I have to go!”
“H-Hey…!”
I brushed off Kokona-chan’s attempt to stop me and ran out into the hallway.
◇◇◇
And now.
I had fled to the courtyard when Riri-chan appeared.
…In smiley-angry mode.
“Hey, what’s going on? Didn’t you work so hard to get Kokona to make a bento for Shindo?”
“I did…”
“Then what’s that on your lap?”
“Kokona-chan’s bento.”
“What’s the meaning of this?!”
That’s what I want to know.
Which cog in the wheel went haywire and caused this to happen?
This was giving me a major headache.
“I… I can’t forgive this…”
Riri-chan gritted her teeth.
“Um…”
“What?”
“Why are you angry, Riri-chan?”
Kokona-chan giving me her bento is an incident.
But it should be a trivial matter for Riri-chan.
So why is she making such a fuss?
“That’s because…!”
“Because…?”
Riri-chan started to say something, then turned away.
“…You’re so dense, Suzuna.”
“Eh…?”
“It’s frustrating when things don’t go as planned, especially after hearing about it from a friend.”
Riri-chan always wants to hear everything from me.
And she gets upset if there’s something I don’t tell her or something she doesn’t know.
I feel like that’s been happening more and more lately.
“I’m sorry. But I’m also troubled by this bento.”
“…You didn’t do this on purpose?”
“There’s no reason for me to do this on purpose, is there?”
I answered her question with a question, but I didn’t understand why Riri-chan was suspicious.
There’s no merit to me receiving Kokona-chan’s bento.
Unless I’m desperately hungry, maybe.
“…Shindo.”
Riri-chan muttered the name, as if she was hesitant to say it.
“Kokona-chan?”
“The older brother!”
It was Shindo Minato, the protagonist.
“What do you mean…?”
“You liked Shindo, didn’t you, Suzuna? You thought that if Kokona stopped giving him lunch, you’d have a chance to give him lunch again, didn’t you?”
That’s… well…
“You’re overthinking it, Riri-chan.”
“What?! You can’t deny it. It’s a fact that you liked him.”
Riri-chan often brings up the topic of Amatsuki Suzuna liking Shindo.
I’ve explained many times that it’s a thing of the past, a mistake typical of childhood friends.
But she always seems unconvinced.
“I can deny it. I don’t have any feelings for him whatsoever.”
I answered from the bottom of my heart, a place of pure nothingness, without a single ripple.
I don’t feel any romantic attraction towards him.
I just want him and the heroines around him to be happy.
…Ignoring the fact that for some reason, I’ve only managed to trigger the collapse routes so far.
“…Can I believe you?”
“Yes.”
I nodded.
Those were my true feelings.
“You’re not lying?”
“I’m not.”
We stared at each other for a while.
Riri-chan muttered, “Okay, I believe you,” and sat down next to me.
“What are you going to do with that?”
She pointed at the bento box on my lap.
“…Well, I guess I have no choice but to eat it. I promised to tell her what I thought.”
“There’s nothing wrong with the food itself, so I guess it can’t be helped.”
She seemed to have given me permission to eat.
Lunch break was limited.
I opened the bento box, ready to eat.
“Ah, that’s annoying.”
Riri-chan’s voice, looking at the contents next to me, was ice-cold.
“Eh, w-what…?”
I understood at a glance.
Kokona-chan’s cooking had improved.
The tamagoyaki was properly yellow, the hamburger was solid.
And she even managed to make asparagus wrapped in bacon.
It was a remarkable improvement overnight, no matter how you looked at it.
“No, this is unacceptable.”
However, Riri-chan was pointing at a piece of tamagoyaki nestled in the corner of the bento box.
“Eh… do you hate eggs, Riri-chan?”
“That’s not it, it’s the shape.”
The shape…?
It was a little lopsided, but it was shaped like a heart.
“What’s this supposed to be?”
“…Showing off her skills?”
“This is definitely strange. She was going to give this to you, Suzuna, right? So why go through all this trouble to make it cute…?”
Riri-chan’s mood continued to worsen.
What should I do? No matter what I do, the situation doesn’t improve.
“Well, I’ll just try it…”
“No.”
She closed the lid of the bento box.
“Um, Riri-chan…?”
“You can’t eat this.”
“But I can’t tell what it tastes like if I don’t eat it.”
“You just have to tell her what you think, right? Then I’ll eat it.”
“Eh…”
What kind of thought process led her to that conclusion?
“You can’t eat this, Suzuna. You’ll be tainted.”
“It’s not poisoned or anything…”
“You’ll be tainted by Kokona!”
“Eh…”
Riri-chan was in a particularly bad mood today.
------------------ 
17 Feelings as Seasoning
“No, I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to eat it, Riri-chan.”
I smoothly dodged Riri-chan’s hand as she tried to take the bento box.
“No way, it’s unacceptable for Suzuna to eat another girl’s cooking.”
“…Girlfriend, much?”
What’s with that line?
I thought she didn’t get along with Kokona-chan, but there’s no need to be so dramatic.
This assertive pushiness, forcing her opinion on others, is typical Hinase Riri.
This aggressiveness should be directed at Shindo-kun…
What went wrong to cause this?
…Ah, it was my fault.
“Girlfriend? Me?”
Oblivious to my inner turmoil, Riri-chan blinked.
Yeah, I know it’s absurd, but…
It’s Riri-chan’s fault for making such a suggestive remark.
“I’m kidding, but getting so worked up about someone else’s bento is like a girlfriend’s reaction.”
It’s like a maiden consumed by jealousy.
I know Riri-chan didn’t mean it that way, but that’s how it sounded.
“Eh, so you’re saying Suzuna is the “boyfriend”?”
“I said I was kidding.”
“I’m talking about the joke.”
This conversation is ridiculous, but if we had to choose who’s the boyfriend and who’s the girlfriend…
“…Well, it feels the other way around.”
“Why?”
“Because you take the lead, Riri-chan.”
“Ehehe… do you think so?”
Riri-chan seemed happy for some reason.
“So, Suzuna is the girlfriend, huh…”
“…Well, I’m more of a pet than a girlfriend, aren’t I?”
And I proceeded to dismantle the premise of our own conversation.
I’m not worthy of being a girlfriend, being treated like a pet suits me better.
Happily receiving food and then going to sleep.
That kind of life isn’t bad.
“Suzuna is a pet…?!”
And for some reason, Riri-chan’s breathing grew ragged.
“That sounds nice, I’m envious. The pet life.”
“What?! Do you have some kind of kink?!”
“…No, it’s much simpler than that.”
Apparently, she thought I had some warped fetish.
“S-So you want to be kept by someone…?”
Well… if I had to answer that question directly…
“Yeah, that might be nice. So don’t take my food.”
I hugged the bento box protectively, hiding it with my body.
“G-Gladly…”
Riri-chan gave a strange reply.
◇◇◇
“Ah, welcome back, Amatsuki Suzuna.”
Back in the classroom, Kokona-chan was waiting for me.
…In my seat.
I’m not even going to ask why anymore.
“I-I’m back…”
“So, how was it? How did the bento taste?”
Kokona-chan looked at me expectantly.
I think she was fairly confident.
The taste had certainly improved a lot.
“It was… so-so.”
Riri-chan, next to me, immediately replied.
(I begged her not to follow me, but she insisted on being there for this.)
“Hinase Riri…, I wasn’t asking you.”
“I ate some too.”
“Huh…? I didn’t make it for you.”
“The goal was to get feedback on the taste, right? Then it’s better to have more opinions. Or is there some reason why only Suzuna is allowed to eat it?”
What’s with these two…?
Why are they being so combative?
“Are you delusional…? That doesn’t give you the right to eat it.”
“Can’t you appreciate my generosity in allowing Suzuna to eat it? I could have taken it all away…”
She said that, but Riri-chan barely touched the bento.
She only ate the heart-shaped tamagoyaki, saying, “I just can’t forgive this.”
I didn’t understand why she was so fixated on it.
“Hey, Amatsuki Suzuna, why did you let her eat it?”
“S-Sorry…”
The spear of her anger turned towards me.
I bowed my head to the displeased Kokona-chan.
“…And, um, I’ve been meaning to ask… why are you talking so informally?”
…And next to me was a gal radiating even more displeasure.
“Are you telling me to use honorifics?”
“That’s common courtesy.”
W-Well… Kokona-chan’s attitude towards her upperclassmen isn’t exactly polite.
I understand that she doesn’t feel the age difference because she has an older brother, and I understand that she’s friendly with Amatsuki Suzuna, whom she’s known since childhood.
But it’s not appropriate with Hinase Riri, who’s at the top of the social hierarchy.
“Heh… Hinase Riri, with your rule-breaking makeup and uniform, is lecturing me about courtesy? You can’t even follow the school rules, and you’re talking about courtesy? That’s a new one.”
“…Gah.”
Ah, Riri-chan was so stunned by that perfect counterattack that she was speechless…
“There are people like that, you know, who impose their narrow-minded views of common sense and courtesy on others. You should try to see the bigger picture.”
“I just care a little about my appearance. And what about you? Barging into an upperclassman’s classroom and bringing your brother lunch… Couldn’t you just give it to him at home?!”
No, don’t say that, Riri-chan.
If you do that, you’ll completely miss the Kokona-chan events.
It’s due to circumstances beyond our control. Please understand… well, that’s probably impossible.
“Th-That’s true…”
Kokona-chan seemed surprised, as if she’d just realized something.
Y-Yeah… well, there are things like that.
Things you do without thinking that don’t actually make sense.
“So, you don’t have to give Suzuna a bento anymore. Suzuna said she doesn’t need one!”
I had no idea what that “so” was supposed to mean, but Riri-chan was resorting to brute force.
“What’s that supposed to mean…? I don’t need Hinase Riri’s permission.”
“B-But, Kokona-chan, I also feel bad about receiving a bento. It tasted good, so I think you’ll be fine from now on.”
Or rather, since the Shindo-kun bento event is gone, it doesn’t matter anymore.
Anyway, all the gears are starting to turn in the wrong direction, so I don’t want any more complicated settings added.
“…Fine. If it tasted good, then it’s fine.”
Kokona-chan agreed more readily than I expected.
“So, how about Kokona-chan goes back to her class, and Riri-chan goes back to her seat?”
It’s strange for these two to be gathered around me.
Originally, the heroines were supposed to gather around Shindo Minato, who sits in front of me.
If that’s not possible, then let’s at least separate.
Let’s separate and rethink our strategies.
“No, I’m not going back until I hear specifically what Amatsuki Suzuna liked about the bento.”
“Huh? You don’t need to hear that.”
…Please.
Please go back, both of you.

18 Appearance and Heart
“Hey, Suzuna. Um… those pigtails… do you have any particular reason for wearing them?”
After school.
I was walking home alone, stiffening against the chilly evening wind, when Riri-chan caught up to me.
Resigned, I walked with her, and she suddenly said those words.
“No, not really…”
“Hmm… I thought there was some reason.”
Hair is an important element for girls.
It shapes their appearance, and they take care in how they style it.
That’s true for both the individual and for others.
So, Riri-chan bringing it up means she has something to say.
Especially since I haven’t changed my hair color or style.
“Is it… strange…?”
“It’s not strange, but… I was just wondering if you ever change it up.”
Well… it’s something a fashionable girl like Riri-chan would be curious about.
Amatsuki Suzuna’s hairstyle isn’t trendy or anything.
Her black bangs are heavy, completely covering her forehead.
Her tightly braided pigtails fall onto her shoulders.
She looks like an old Japanese doll.
“But I’ve always worn it like this.”
That’s the kind of character Amatsuki Suzuna is.
She doesn’t care about her appearance or what others think.
A pure-hearted, somewhat twisted girl who only wants to be by Shindo Minato’s side.
I can’t agree with everything about her, but I can relate to her indifference towards her appearance.
That’s why I haven’t felt any discomfort continuing with this look, and the pigtails have become a habit, not something I find bothersome.
“But you said you don’t have any particular attachment to it, right?”
“Well… yeah.”
“Then why don’t you change your hairstyle sometimes? Pigtails are fine, but I think changing things up would be cute.”
Riri-chan is kind.
She’s trying to offer helpful advice without criticizing my unremarkable appearance.
I understand that.
But…
“It’s fine. There’s no point in me becoming cuter.”
I don’t think I can become cuter anyway.
But even if I believed Riri-chan’s words…
There’s no point in me improving my appearance.
I’m a character no one is interested in, and the only one who pays attention to me is my childhood friend, Shindo Minato.
What would happen if I improved my appearance and made a good impression on him?
The risk of increasing his affection value would only go up.
See, there’s no point in me trying to look better.
So it’s fine the way it is.
“Eh? That’s not true. You can become much cuter, Suzuna.”
“…I’m saying there’s no point even if I do.”
“Do you need a reason to become cuter?”
Riri-chan looked surprised, as if I’d said something revolutionary.
Well, a girl who genuinely pursues fashion wouldn’t even consider such a question…
“I need a reason. There’s no one to show it off to.”
Change is stressful in itself.
Doing something different requires a certain level of resolve.
Since I don’t see the point, I can’t bring myself to do it.
“So you’re saying it would be fine if there was someone to show it off to?”
“…If there was… such a person.”
And since that person is Shindo Minato, it’s no good.
It’s definitely better not to do it.
“There is, right here.”
“…Huh?”
Riri-chan pointed at herself, grinning.
“I’ll look at you.”
“…No, what’s that supposed to mean?”
“I’ll be happy if you become cuter, Suzuna.”
She flapped her arms as if saying “Yay!”
She was strangely excited, I don’t know what she finds so amusing.
“That doesn’t make sense. I’m… trash compared to you, Riri-chan.”
Hinase Riri, the beautiful girl with a great figure who always takes care of herself.
And she’s always surrounded by other glamorous girls.
What would Riri-chan find enjoyable about watching an introvert like me change?
“Don’t say that. You have good qualities, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan scolded me gently.
I wonder what motivates her so much.
“I’m not interested in fashion or anything.”
“Eh, then I’ll do it for you! Should I teach you some things?”
Riri-chan’s fingers started moving restlessly.
It somehow seemed like a suggestive gesture, and I instinctively tensed up.
“I-It’s… unnecessary.”
“Why? You’ve just never tried it before. It might be fun if you do.”
“That’s because you’re cute, Riri-chan.”
A cute girl puts in effort to become more beautiful and cute.
And then she gets showered with attention, so of course it’s fun.
But that’s because she already has the potential.
Anything multiplied by zero is still zero.
“Ehehe… don’t flatter me so suddenly, Suzuna. I’m getting embarrassed.”
“You’re used to it.”
I didn’t understand why Riri-chan was happily touching her cheek.
She must have heard this kind of thing from countless people.
“Hmm? Well… some people say that, but it doesn’t make me happy no matter who says it.”
“…Is that so?”
“Yeah, well, some of my friends say it too, but we compliment each other, so I feel like some of it is flattery. Not that it’s a bad thing.”
“But boys must say it to you too, Riri-chan.”
“Well… sometimes. But… how should I put it? I think I come across as… frivolous, so I don’t think many people mean it sincerely…”
Ah… well, Hinase Riri looks like a gal, and her cheerful demeanor could be seen as frivolous, to put it negatively.
There are probably a lot of men who are only interested in her physically.
Come to think of it, my encounter with her also started with something like that.
“Is it tough being a popular girl?”
“I know it might sound like I’m bragging and be annoying, but… I’m not particularly happy about it. I dress like this because I like it, not because I want to be seen that way.”
That felt like a glimpse into a side of Riri-chan I’d never seen before.
I felt like she was showing me a part of herself that was empty and vulnerable.
“…Even you have things you don’t like, Riri-chan.”
“Of course. What do you take me for?”
“…A super positive girl.”
“What’s that?”
Well, I thought social butterflies didn’t have any worries.
I thought, “Sorry for the prejudice,” but I couldn’t say it out loud.
“Anyway, I’m really happy when you compliment me, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan hugged my arm, as if cheering.
“Ah, wait, don’t cling to me…”
“I can’t help but express my feelings!”
Why is her way of expressing herself physical contact…? It’s too direct.
“And that doesn’t explain why you’re happy when I say it…”
I understand why other people’s words don’t reach her.
But that doesn’t explain why my words do.
“Silly. I’m happy just because you said it, Suzuna.”
“…What? Just because it’s me?”
“That’s enough.”
What’s that supposed to mean?
It’s a reason, but it’s not.
And yet, Riri-chan says that’s enough.
“…What if I’m just flattering you?”
“No, I know. You’re telling the truth, Suzuna.”
She seemed absolutely confident for some reason.
“…Are you a psychic?”
“Only for you, Suzuna.”
Only for me, again…
But if she’s happy with my words, then that’s a good thing.
Riri-chan, beaming, rested her head on my shoulder.
Well… we’re not at school.
I’ll just… enjoy Riri-chan’s warmth.
------------------ 
19 Picking Up the Pieces
“…What should I do?”
I stood frozen in front of the bathroom mirror, my hands stilled.
It was because of my conversation with Riri-chan after school yesterday.
“Why don’t you change your hairstyle sometimes?”
Those words were disrupting my usual routine.
“Well, it’s not like I’m particularly attached to pigtails…”
My original self, Yukitsuki Mashiro, wore her black hair straight.
Simply because it was easiest.
Braiding takes effort.
And since I don’t particularly like it, there’s no point…
I only did it to maintain the “Amatsuki Suzuna” character.
But that’s no longer necessary.
I’m not her, and I can’t replicate her way of being.
“…R-Right. I’m just tired of braiding my hair. It’s not like I care about my appearance or that I’m being influenced by Riri-chan’s words. I’m just… too lazy to braid it anymore.”
I muttered to myself, even though no one was listening.
Yes, this is just the process of the lazy me overwriting Amatsuki Suzuna.
That’s all.
Goodbye, Amatsuki Suzuna. Welcome back, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
“…Well, either way, I’m still a plain, gloomy introvert. Haha…”
A dry laugh escaped my lips.
I combed my hair instead of braiding it.
Doing so, I noticed the slight wave in my hair.
“…Should I use a straightener?”
I opened the cabinet under the sink.
I took out a hair straightener that looked barely used.
I set the temperature and waited a few minutes.
After confirming that the light was on and it had heated up, I ran the straightener through my hair.
My wavy hair straightened.
“That should do it.”
As I was about to put the straightener away, I noticed something.
“There are contacts here.”
I instinctively knew they belonged to Amatsuki Suzuna.
My eyesight was just as bad as Amatsuki Suzuna’s, but I usually wore contacts.
It was a natural habit, and I rarely wore glasses.
“Should I wear contacts today?”
…But something didn’t sit right.
She had a straightener and contacts.
Both of these belonged to Amatsuki Suzuna.
But in the original story, there was no scene where she changed her appearance.
Not even in her route.
So why does she have these things?
“…Did Amatsuki Suzuna… actually want to change?”
But she didn’t choose to.
I think she was afraid that changing herself would also change her relationship with Shindo Minato.
Because I am her, and yet not her, I can somehow understand.
It might seem like I’m overthinking it, but it seems like something she, who always prioritizes Shindo Minato, would do.
The self that desires change, and the self that fears it.
She wavered between the two and chose not to change.
She probably tried to play the role of the “unremarkable childhood friend” that was convenient for Shindo Minato.
“But she’s much more admirable than me.”
Still, she made a choice.
Choosing not to change is different from simply standing still.
It’s incredibly painful to want to move forward but remain stationary.
To others, it might look like you’re just standing still, but for the person involved, it’s a constant struggle to suppress the urge to move.
And all for the sake of the person she likes.
Knowing that, I found her admirable.
I could never do that, and I don’t want to, but…
“…Well. Then I’ll become the person you wanted to be.”
For me, Yukitsuki Mashiro, this is a return to my former self.
For her, Amatsuki Suzuna, it’s a change.
So, even though this act is meaningless to me, it might be meaningful for her.
It was also a way for me, Yukitsuki Mashiro, who can’t imagine a future with Shindo Minato, to atone for Amatsuki Suzuna.
◇◇◇
“…That being said, this still feels strange.”
Leaving the house, the wind rustling through my hair felt new.
The absence of the weight of my glasses felt… too light.
Even though this was close to how I looked as Yukitsuki Mashiro, this body is Amatsuki Suzuna’s.
It was unavoidable that I felt a sense of discomfort with this different appearance.
“S-Suzuna…?! Th-That…!!”
“Um…”
Just before entering the downtown area, Riri-chan covered her mouth with her hand.
“Your hair… and your… glasses…!!”
“And please stop ambushing me like this. It’s like we have a standing appointment now.”
“That doesn’t matter! Suzuna, what happened?!”
“What happened…?”
Riri-chan seemed to hear my words but not listen to them.
She was only interested in the change in my appearance.
“You hated it so much yesterday, what made you change your mind?”
“I-It’s fine. Braiding is a pain, and my glasses get in the way during P.E.”
“Hee… I see… Hmm.”
Riri-chan grinned and moved closer.
Her intense stare was a bit uncomfortable.
“Don’t stare so much, it’s not a big deal.”
I just stopped braiding my hair and wearing glasses.
That’s all.
“No, it makes a big difference. I like it, you look cute, Suzuna.”
“That’s enough. I don’t need your flattery.”
I didn’t do this to be complimented, and I didn’t want Riri-chan’s opinion.
“It’s not flattery. Really, you look cute, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan stared intently into my eyes, emphasizing her words.
I know she’s serious when she has that earnest look in her eyes.
Or rather, I know that Riri-chan wouldn’t lie to me.
“That’s enough. You don’t have to keep saying it.”
Still, her serious tone made me look away.
It’s not normal to say “cute” with such intensity.
“…Suzuna, are you blushing?”
“I’m not.”
“Your ears are red.”
“They’re not.”
I was aware that my face was getting hot.
But I couldn’t admit it.
Admitting it would mean acknowledging that her words had affected me.
“Then can I touch them to check?”
“No.”
“Why?”
“Because they’re not meant to be touched.”
“Then your hair is fine, right?”
A compromise: my hair. I don’t understand the logic.
“Well… fine.”
But my body heat wouldn’t transfer through my hair.
If this would end the conversation, then so be it.
“Really? Yay!”
Riri-chan gently touched my hair with her fingers.
She ran her fingers through it, and strands of hair slipped through her fingers.
“So smooth.”
“…I haven’t done anything to damage it.”
“Just like you, Suzuna.”
“What do you mean?”
“Straight and beautiful.”
Why is she suddenly so poetic?
Did she forget her sense of shame somewhere?
“That’s enough, let’s go to school.”
“Ah, wait. Tell me why you changed your mind.”
“…The reason?”
“You wanted to change things up too, didn’t you, Suzuna?”
“…Half of it.”
“Half?”
The other half was the lingering feelings of Amatsuki Suzuna.
I think I picked up those feelings.
That’s probably why my heart feels a little lighter.
------------------ 
20 Somewhere, Someday
While I believe that a classroom in the morning should be quiet, that ideal rarely comes to fruition in a group setting.
Some students are quiet and well-behaved, but the majority are chatting and laughing with their friends.
So even in the morning, the classroom is filled with noise.
I slipped into my seat, trying to blend in with the background noise.
In front of me were the close-knit Shindo siblings, but I don’t understand why they’re together in the morning.
“I’m telling you, if you want lunch, you can just buy it at the school store.”
“Do you think I can handle those crowds? You could at least buy something for me!”
“No! Buy it yourself!”
“Every morning!?”
“Yes! Everyone else does it!”
“That’s them, this is us!”
“That’s why I’m saying this is how we’ll do it from now on!!”
…Ah.
Apparently, they’re arguing about lunch.
I think Shindo-kun should just buy it himself.
Still, it’s kind of Kokona-chan to even discuss it with him.
She could easily just ignore him.
Shindo-kun should be more grateful to Kokona-chan.
Thinking that, I silently sat down at my desk.
“Hey, listen to this, Suzuna! Kokona is telling me to prepare my own lunch every day…”
“Tell Amatsuki Suzuna too! That’s normal, and it’s strange for Onii-chan to even complain…”
Ah, they’re not going to leave me alone, are they?
I don’t think I can mediate between these two…
“Shindo-kun, it’s normal to prepare your own lunch. If you really can’t do it, why don’t you take turns with your sister? Preparing one portion or two portions isn’t that different, and the effort is literally halved.”
How about that?
I think it’s a pretty good compromise.
“…”
“…”
They both stared at me blankly, speechless.
“Um, being ignored after giving advice hurts, you know…”
I don’t remember saying anything strange.
“S-Suzuna… that…”
“A-Amatsuki Suzuna… that…”
The Shindo siblings spoke in similar voices.
They were both looking at my face…
And I somehow understood.
“…What? Do you have a problem with something?”
Unable to bear the silence, I spoke up.
If they’re not going to react, then don’t. If they are, then do. I want them to be clear.
Honestly, I’d prefer if they just pretended not to notice.
But that’s impossible with these two.
“You… you were always so stubbornly pigtails and glasses… why?!”
“Y-Yeah! You’ve had pigtails and glasses since we were little, like it was the only thing you knew!”
There was no way these two, who have known me for so long, would miss the change.
I didn’t expect such a big reaction, though…
“I-It’s fine, isn’t it…?”
“No way! There has to be a reason for Suzuna to do something so drastic! What is it? What happened?!”
I wonder if they’d believe me if I said I was reborn.
And Kokona-chan next to him gasped, as if she realized something.
“You idiot, Onii-chan! It’s obvious!!”
“Eh?! …Ah! I see. A broken heart! You had your heart broken, didn’t you, Suzuna?!”
“…No, I didn’t.”
I haven’t even been in love in the first place.
“Onii-chan, you’re so insensitive! She can’t just say that! Be more considerate!!”
“B-But there’s no way Suzuna would keep secrets from me…”
“There are some things she can’t tell you precisely because you’re her Onii-chan!!”
“Eh, she can’t tell me because it’s me? What’s that supposed to mean?”
“You really don’t understand a girl’s heart! And you can’t even understand her feelings even though you’re her childhood friend… You’re such a jerk! So insensitive!!”
“That’s harsh!”
But even as she said that, Kokona-chan’s eyes were welling up with tears.
“Amatsuki Suzuna is trying so hard to act like she’s okay, but she’s actually hurting!”
…I feel like Kokona-chan is also misunderstanding something.
I could strongly sense the unspoken implication: “You needed a change like this to get over Onii-chan, right? It was your first heartbreak, after all.”
“Wh-Who is he?! Hey, Suzuna, who did this to you?!”
“It’s you, Onii-chan!!”
Kokona-chan slapped Shindo-kun on the head.
“It’s me?!”
Ah… they’re definitely misunderstanding…
But saying “I just wanted a change of pace” wouldn’t be convincing.
And I can’t tell them the truth.
More importantly…
“Kokona is so disappointed! I thought you understood Amatsuki Suzuna a little better, even if you are her Onii-chan!”
“Huh?! I thought I understood her! And why are you crying, Kokona?!”
I can’t keep up with their energy…
This was the first time in my life I’ve ever looked forward to homeroom so much.
◇◇◇
“Ah… I forgot to buy lunch.”
It’s because I did something unusual this morning.
When I do something new, I always forget something.
“This is a pain, but I guess I’ll go to the school store…”
I reluctantly stood up.
Shindo-kun turned around.
“You know, the more I look at you, the more you seem like a different person.”
Shindo-kun stared at my appearance again.
It felt uncomfortable, like I was being appraised, but it might be a welcome development for Amatsuki Suzuna, so I endured his gaze for her sake.
“…Is it bad?”
“No, I think it’s fine. You look more girly this way.”
“Hmm…”
“What’s with that reaction? Be a little more grateful.”
“I can’t when you’re talking down to me.”
“…Seriously?”
Shindo-kun should be more careful with his words.
He can’t get his message across when he talks like that.
The heroines in this world have an amazing ability to interpret his words, but…
There’s something I want to ask Shindo-kun.
“But, Shindo-kun, how do you feel about me changing like this? Don’t you dislike it, as my childhood friend?”
“Not really. If it’s what you want, Suzuna, then it’s fine. I like it too.”
It would be easier to listen to him if it weren’t for that last unnecessary line…
But apparently, Shindo-kun doesn’t think this change is bad.
“Then… she might be happy about it.”
“…Who?”
“The person who cares about you, Shindo-kun.”
“So, who?!”
Amatsuki Suzuna.
Your feelings won’t be reciprocated in this world line.
But if there’s another world somewhere… I hope you change.
Because you’ll probably be able to get closer to your ideal.
------------------ 
21 Each Other’s Positions
“Here, Suzuna. Say ‘ahh.’”
“…”
I was sitting on the courtyard bench, a spot that had become my regular haunt.
And the beautiful girl next to me was holding a piece of tamagoyaki, poised on her chopsticks, in front of my face.
…I don’t understand.
“Hey, why aren’t you opening your mouth?”
Her name is Hinase Riri.
At first glance, she’s a gal, but she’s a cute girl with a surprisingly serious and domestic side.
I know all that, but I don’t understand this situation.
“Well, I was just wondering…”
“Wondering what? I told you I’d share my bento with you, Suzuna.”
That’s right.
I had forgotten my lunch and was on my way to the school store.
I ran into Riri-chan in the hallway.
“Oh, Suzuna. What are you doing?”
“I forgot my lunch. I’m going to buy something.”
“Ah, perfect timing!”
“Perfect timing?”
“Come on, Suzuna.”
“W-Wait, Riri-chan. Don’t drag me…”
And the result of being forcibly dragged away was this.
Riri-chan opened a large bento box and was offering to share her lunch with me.
“…No, it’s okay. I’ll buy something myself.”
“No, I’m giving it to you. Eat it, here.”
She pushed the tamagoyaki closer, practically to the point of kissing it. She was being very forceful.
“B-But if I eat it, there won’t be any left for you, Riri-chan…”
“It’s okay, I made extra today.”
“Eh, why…?”
“So I could give some to you, Suzuna.”
“Why would you do that…?”
I’ve never heard of someone making extra lunch for a friend.
The Shindo siblings are family, so that makes sense.
…I’ll ignore the fact that Amatsuki Suzuna used to make lunch for her childhood friend. She was an anomaly.
“Just eat it.”
“You’re being too forceful, Riri-chan.”
I couldn’t accept such inexplicable kindness.
“Don’t tell me… you could eat Kokona’s bento, but you can’t eat mine…?”
Ah…
This is bad.
She’s smiling, but her eyes aren’t.
I could sense her unspoken message: “I’ll be angry if you refuse again.”
“You can eat your childhood friend’s little sister’s bento, but you can’t eat your friend’s? That’s unacceptable.”
“…Y-Yes.”
“Right? Here, eat.”
But…
Why is the tamagoyaki she’s offering heart-shaped?
Kokona-chan’s heart-shaped tamagoyaki was bad, but Riri-chan’s is okay?
What’s the criteria? I want to know.
“Come on, say ‘ahh.’”
“…Ahh.”
But right now, I need to deal with Riri-chan’s pressure.
The tamagoyaki entered my mouth.
A fluffy texture and a gentle sweetness spread through my mouth.
“How is it?”
Her serious expression showed she genuinely cared about my opinion.
“…It’s delicious.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, you’re a good cook, Riri-chan.”
I knew she was supposed to be good at cooking, but those words came out naturally after actually tasting it.
“Ehehe…”
This time, Riri-chan’s smile was genuine.
I was relieved that she was no longer angry.
“There’s still plenty, so eat up.”
But she immediately switched gears and picked up a piece of salmon, offering it to me.
…However.
“Um… listen.”
“Hmm? What?”
“Can’t I just eat it myself?”
For some reason, Riri-chan wouldn’t give me the chopsticks and wouldn’t let go of the bento box.
She was determined to feed me.
“It’s fine, I’ll feed you.”
“No, it’s weird.”
“You’re so fussy, Suzuna.”
No, I’m definitely not.
I just want to feed myself.
“Besides, what if someone sees us?”
It’s already strange enough that we’re together.
If someone sees her feeding me, I don’t know what they’ll think.
“It’s fine even if someone sees us.”
“No, it’s not. It’s already weird that you and I are together, Riri-chan. And if people find out you’re feeding me, they’ll definitely think it’s strange.”
“…Then what do you want, Suzuna?”
“I’ll gratefully accept it this time… but from now on, I’ll eat by myself like usual.”
It’s only because it’s early spring that no one comes to the courtyard.
As it gets warmer, more people will come.
Then it will be difficult to use this place as a hiding spot.
“…Humph.”
“Eh?”
This is bad.
Riri-chan puffed out her cheeks.
She clearly wasn’t happy.
Is this really such a big deal for her?
“So, until when do we have to keep sneaking around like this, Suzuna?”
“Well… I think it’s better if we do, for now…”
“Even though we’re friends?”
“Well… everyone will think it’s weird that you and I are friends, Riri-chan.”
“Aren’t you the only one who thinks that, Suzuna?”
“…Because no one knows yet. If everyone knew, most people would find it strange.”
They’d wonder, “Why is that plain girl next to Hinase Riri?”
I can already imagine them saying we’re a mismatched pair.
“Isn’t that strange?”
“Uh, well…”
But Riri-chan didn’t seem convinced.
She glared at me, as if she had something to say.
“I’m only doing this because you told me not to interact with you in public. But I’m not going to keep hiding forever.”
“…No, this isn’t just for me. I’m also saying this for your sake, Riri-chan.”
Of course, I don’t want to be teased by my classmates for getting ahead of myself.
But I’m also worried about Riri-chan.
If the queen bee interacts with the bottom rung, it’ll damage Riri-chan’s brand.
She’s in a good position, so she should stay there.
“…How is that for my sake?”
“Uh, well…”
Ah, this is bad.
The atmosphere has changed.
I don’t think I said anything wrong.
But I’m making Riri-chan more and more upset.
“I just want to be friends with you, Suzuna, that’s all.”
“…Ah, okay.”
And why is Riri-chan so straightforward with her feelings?
Being told that directly makes me unsure of how to respond.
“But you won’t let me, Suzuna. Why?”
“…Because… we’re not a good match, Riri-chan.”
“That’s just your assumption, Suzuna. No one thinks that.”
…No, Riri-chan is being too optimistic.
Social life isn’t that simple.
Everyone is aware of their own position and acts accordingly.
There’s some leeway for moving up or down. That’s normal.
But someone from the bottom can’t suddenly jump to the top.
Because they don’t have the qualifications.
It’s common sense that someone acting above their station will be knocked back down.
“…You don’t understand, Riri-chan. You don’t understand what it’s like to be an introvert like me.”
I don’t expect her to understand, and I don’t think she needs to.
Just like someone at the bottom can’t understand someone at the top, someone at the top can’t understand someone at the bottom.
So this situation is natural.
It’s not Riri-chan’s fault.
It’s my fault for shamelessly being next to her when we’re not a good match.
“…That’s it.”
“…Eh?”
But for some reason, she wouldn’t accept it.
“If that’s how you feel, Suzuna, then I have a plan!”
Riri-chan’s eyes were burning with passion.
------------------ 
22 A Child Who Isn’t Straightforward: Hinase Riri’s Side
Amatsuki Suzuna is a girl who always runs away.
Reserved, quiet, and dislikes standing out.
That’s fine.
Even I know that everyone has their own comfort zone.
But I want her to remember that she was the one who crossed the line first.
◇◇◇
It was spring, just after we became second-years. I still hadn’t fully settled into the new class. After school, I was killing time in town when a shady-looking man approached me.
“You’re cute, so… I think you could easily earn money, even if it’s just for 1 or 2 hours a day.”
I’d been approached by strangers before, but that was within the school, and they were teenagers like me.
Being approached by an adult man is scary.
My body stiffened instinctively.
“Huh? What’s that? Super sketchy, it’s creepy. I’m not struggling for money, anyway.”
My fear translated into a defiant tone.
“Lies, dressed like that, there’s no way you’re not interested. It’s not sketchy at all, so just listen to what I have to say, and you can refuse if you don’t like it.”
Was he used to this kind of response?
Or did he think dealing with a young girl was easy?
Anyway, the man didn’t miss a beat, continuing as if it were nothing.
“I’m already refusing. Seriously, you’re persistent.”
I raised my voice reflexively.
I’m sure my voice echoed even in the crowded street.
Yet, I didn’t make eye contact with anyone passing by.
The passersby avoided me with unnatural haste.
Seeing a high school girl arguing with a man in a suit, they probably didn’t think it was a lovers’ quarrel.
The people here just didn’t want to get involved in trouble.
I was in trouble, I wanted someone to help me.
But I had no one to rely on at that moment.
“Ah, ahhh. Sorry, sorry, were you waiting?”
A girl’s voice, strangely high-pitched, rang out.
She had black hair in pigtails and was wearing black-rimmed glasses.
I immediately recognized her as a classmate in the same uniform.
“Uh, um…?”
I was flustered and couldn’t speak properly.
I didn’t know her, and I certainly hadn’t arranged to meet her.
So why did she speak to me at this moment, when everyone else was just passing by?
“Shopping first? Come on, we don’t have time, let’s go.”
She took my arm.
I felt a strong, unwavering will in her grip.
“Hey, wait a minute!”
The man in the suit was still trying to talk to me.
The girl glared at the troublesome man.
“Sir, this girl and I have something to do. Besides, if you keep pestering her, I’ll call the police. You’re targeting a minor, and if rumors spread, it could affect your job, you know? Is that okay with you?”
“…Tch, whatever, fine.”
Defeated by her clear hostility and determination, the man backed down, looking annoyed.
“Let’s go, Hinase-san.”
The girl said my name clearly.
She easily drove the man away and helped me with her own hands.
It was the first time anything like that had ever happened to me.
“Ah, y-yeah!”
I followed her lead.
I thought her back, her glossy black hair swaying, was beautiful.
That was the moment I became truly aware of her—Amatsuki Suzuna.
◇◇◇
The problem was what happened afterward.
“Amatsuki-san, do you like sweets?”
I tried to thank Suzuna and asked about her preferences.
“I hate them.”
She replied instantly in a blunt, unfriendly tone.
After that, no matter what I asked, she denied everything.
“I’m going home.”
And then she just left.
I had no idea what her motive was.
◇◇◇
But I wouldn’t give up.
I woke up early and waited for Suzuna in the morning so I could talk to her.
“Good morning, Amatsuki-san!”
She clearly looked like she was about to run away, so I hugged her arm to stop her.
And when I tried to get closer—
“Um… when are you going to let go of my arm?”
—This.
Hey, you were the one who grabbed my arm and helped me!
Why do you hate it when I do it?
And that was the first and last time Suzuna ever touched me.
Unbelievable.
“Hinase-san, what do you think of me?”
Then, Suzuna suddenly asked a bold question.
“Hm? I like you?”
I pressed on.
I desperately tried to show my affection, to become closer to her.
“What about you, Amatsuki-san? What do you think of me?”
Surely this would bring us closer?!
“…N-Normal.”
Huh?!
I don’t understand, I don’t understand.
And then she just ran away. What’s with this girl?!
◇◇◇
Even so, I wouldn’t be discouraged.
I made plans with her after school and exchanged contact information.
Then Suzuna was glued to her phone, staring at it.
“Um, Amatsuki-san? What’s wrong? Why are you staring at my phone so much?”
“…No, it’s just, you’re cheating, Hinase-san.”
“Eh, what is?”
“Looking this cute in such normal clothes… Give me a break. If I wore that, it would just be pajamas.”
Why would she suddenly say something like that?!
This girl is a whiplash of sweet and harsh!!
“And is this picture edited? It’s not, is it?”
“Well, look. I did edit my legs to make them thinner.”
“Ehh…?”
Suzuna zoomed in on my profile picture and stared at it.
No, no, no!! Don’t look at it like that!!
And I should have changed it to a more flattering picture if I knew Suzuna was going to see it!!
“They’re the same.”
And then she complimented me in a casual tone.
The sudden shift is too much, it’s making me flustered.
◇◇◇
I continued my efforts.
—I fed her pancakes at the cafe and got her to acknowledge me as a friend.
—I got her to call me by my first name in the music room.
—I patted her head when she was feeling down in the classroom after school.
W-Well?
It would be a lie to say there wasn’t a rewarding aspect for me.
But I’ve tried my best to be there for Suzuna.
I know she’s the type of person who likes to keep her distance.
So I tried to approach her at her pace.
…And yet, lately, it’s been bad.
—She told me she actually liked Shindo Minato and used to make him lunch every day.
—She went out of her way to make lunch for his little sister and tried to teach her how to cook.
And more than anything!!
—She said she doesn’t want to be close to me at school.
No way!!
I thought I’d been respecting Suzuna’s feelings as much as possible.
I thought she was just trying to distance herself from me at school because it was too sudden and she wasn’t used to it.
But if she intends to keep doing that, it’s a different story.
It doesn’t make sense for her to be close to Shindo (the older brother) and Kokona, but not me.
School caste?
What’s that?
There’s no such thing at school, and even if there was, I don’t care.
I just want to be friends with Suzuna.
I don’t need any other reason.
But Suzuna keeps coming up with nonsensical excuses.
“If that’s how you feel, Suzuna, then I have a plan!”
So I decided to change Suzuna myself.
------------------ 
23 Seeping In
I feel restless.
The monotonous tapping of chalk against the blackboard, the math teacher’s low, monotone voice.
The afternoon classes always make me drowsy, but today, there’s no sign of sleepiness.
It’s Riri-chan’s fault.
“I have a plan!”
She wouldn’t tell me what it was.
During lunch break, she just kept feeding me her bento.
Her eyes were sparkling, and I knew she was planning something.
I’m uneasy.
I can’t stop wondering what she’s going to do.
I couldn’t concentrate on class at all.
◇◇◇
Class ended, and it was break time.
“Suzuna?”
I flinched.
Riri-chan’s clear, high-pitched voice.
She called out to me from a distance.
Several people must have heard her. Riri-chan never does that in class.
“…”
I pretended not to hear and looked down at the grain of my desk.
“Suzuna~”
“…”
W-What is this?
What is she doing?
Why is she deliberately calling attention to me? What is she trying to do?
“Hey, Suzuna. Hinase is calling you.”
Shindo-kun informed me.
I know, I can hear her.
Please understand that I’m ignoring her.
“It’s not me.”
I replied, still staring at the wood grain.
“No, she’s clearly looking at you and calling ‘Suzuna.’”
“…It’s not me.”
“It is you. Ah, she’s coming this way.”
“Eh?”
W-What is this?
What does Riri-chan want from me?
“Suzuna, can’t you hear me?”
Riri-chan’s voice was right next to me.
I glanced sideways, and my eyes fell on her short skirt and thighs.
Those legs definitely belonged to Riri-chan.
“…I’m busy right now.”
“…You just look like you’re staring at your desk.”
“That’s what I’m doing.”
“Isn’t that the same as doing nothing?”
“It’s not.”
I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore, but I’m being stubborn.
I avoided eye contact with Riri-chan, trying to maintain an indifferent attitude so she would go away.
“Then look at this.”
A math formula appeared before my eyes.
Riri-chan slid a textbook between me and my desk.
“…I’d rather look at the wood grain.”
“What kind of hobby is that? Just teach me this.”
Riri-chan pointed to a problem we had been working on in the latter half of the class.
It was a problem that used a formula we had just learned today.
“…Teach you?”
“Yeah, I didn’t understand this problem, so I’m asking you to teach me.”
…No one has ever asked me that before.
I don’t know much about Hinase Riri’s grades, but she wasn’t the type of character to immediately ask about something she didn’t understand in class. She wasn’t that studious.
So why is she asking me this?
“Won’t you teach me? You’re good at math, right, Suzuna?”
I’m not particularly good at math, but I can answer the question Riri-chan asked.
However, I’m hesitant to do it in the classroom.
“You can ask your friends, Riri-chan.”
Why did she come all the way over here, away from her usual spot in the center of the classroom?
She can ask the other high-ranking students.
“That’s why I’m asking you, Suzuna.”
“…”
Riri-chan’s voice is always clear and easy to understand.
Unlike me, who mumbles.
But right now, it’s bothersome.
I can’t stop worrying about whether other people in the class can hear our conversation.
“Hey. Teach me.”
“Your voice is too loud, Riri-chan.”
“Will you teach me if I lower my voice?”
“…After school.”
“No, now.”
“Why?”
“I’ll forget if I wait.”
I’ve never talked about studying with Riri-chan before.
So she definitely isn’t that studious.
Is this the “plan” she was talking about during lunch break?
“I’ll stay here until you teach me.”
That’s a problem.
It’s strange for Hinase Riri, who attracts so much attention, to be standing next to Amatsuki Suzuna, who’s looking down at her desk.
Or rather, I can already imagine people wondering, “Why is Hinase Riri just standing there while Amatsuki Suzuna is ignoring her?”
“…Fine.”
I gave in.
I’ll quickly explain it and have her go back to her seat.
I looked up and faced the textbook.
“How much do you understand?”
“Hmm? I didn’t understand it from the beginning.”
…Seriously?
That means she wasn’t listening at all.
She really isn’t interested in studying.
“So, please explain it to me carefully, so even I can understand.”
So she wants me to teach her everything.
I feel like that’s going to take a while.
“…You can use this formula.”
I pointed to the next page, which had the explanation, and told her that all she had to do was use this formula.
The problem was solved instantly.
Now, please go away.
“Well, if it’s that easy, we don’t need schools or teachers.”
I couldn’t argue with that logic.
“So you don’t need them, Riri-chan.”
But I pressed on.
“Yes, I do. Otherwise, I wouldn’t understand.”
“Then pay attention in class. You would have understood if you listened.”
“Afternoon classes are sleepy.”
She was sleeping…?
Of course she wouldn’t understand.
“I understand how you feel, but you should try to stay awake and listen. You’ll get confused again.”
“It’s fine. I can ask Amatsuki-sensei to teach me.”
“…I’m not a teacher.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t fall asleep in Amatsuki-sensei’s class.”
I didn’t agree to this.
I never agreed to this.
Riri-chan is saying whatever she wants.
And I realized that this conversation wasn’t progressing at all, just wasting time.
“Fine, I’ll teach you, but listen carefully.”
“Okay. Thank you, Amatsuki-sensei.”
Riri-chan bent her knees and crouched down.
She brought her face level with the desk and gripped the edge with her fingertips.
Smiling brightly, she waited for my explanation.
Anyone could see that we were close.
I explained it to Riri-chan, half-heartedly.
◇◇◇
In the end, the time it took for her to understand and the end of break time coincided perfectly.
“Thanks, Suzuna. Teach me again if I don’t understand something.”
“…No.”
“Yes, you will. See you later.”
Riri-chan waved and returned to her seat.
Too embarrassed to turn around, I bowed my head slightly.
Then I stared at the wood grain of my desk.
In the end, wouldn’t Riri-chan have stayed by my side until the end of break time whether I taught her or not?
Or rather, explaining things probably made it look like we were talking even more.
It might have been better if she had just stood there silently.
“Suzuna, you were pretty close with Hinase, weren’t you?”
…See, Shindo-kun has already picked up on it.
Rumors spread quickly.
Once they start, they don’t stop.
So I have to stop them before they spread.
“We’re not close.”
“No, that’s the first time I’ve seen you talk to anyone that much besides me.”
“I was just explaining something. We’re not close.”
“Even though you called her ‘Riri-chan’?”
“…Well, I call Kokona-chan ‘-chan’ too.”
“Hinase was calling you ‘Suzuna.’ She was calling you ‘Amatsuki-san’ until recently, wasn’t she?”
“…”
I see.
So even the way we address each other reveals so much about our relationship.
Such a small thing easily invalidates my denial.
“You’re friends, right? Why are you hiding it? You can tell me.”
“…Sort of.”
I confessed.
I feel like I’m gradually falling into Riri-chan’s trap.
My shell is slowly being eroded by her.
There are no cracks yet, but…
Her presence is starting to fill the space around me.
I’m not confident I can resist Hinase Riri.
That was a bit of a shock.
Me, who is always so desperate to protect my boundaries, can’t deny her—
“…It’s as if I’m looking forward to being consumed by Riri-chan.”
—That’s what I thought.
------------------ 
24 I’m Always the One Who Cares
“Alright, Suzuna. Let’s go home together.”
“Eh…”
After school, Riri-chan spoke to me.
It seemed like a normal occurrence, yet it wasn’t.
Because we were in the classroom right after homeroom, and most of our classmates were still there.
Going home together in this situation would be like announcing our friendship to everyone.
“It’s normal for friends to go home together, right?”
“W-Well…”
She was serious.
Riri-chan seriously intended to go home from school with me.
“Hey, Riri, what are you doing?”
A girl’s voice called out from behind Riri-chan.
It was Tachibana Kaede-san.
She’s often with Riri-chan, and also high up in the school caste.
She’s beautiful, but her sharp demeanor gives her an unapproachable aura.
“Ah, sorry, Kaede. I’m going home with Suzuna today, so you guys go ahead without me.”
“Oh, okay. That’s fine, but… that’s unusual.”
Tachibana-san, standing next to Riri-chan, glanced at me.
She must be thinking, “What are you doing with such a plain girl?”
I can tell.
“Yeah, we recently became friends.”
“Hmm. I didn’t know that.”
“Right, Suzuna?”
Riri-chan brought me into the conversation, even though it would have been fine if they just talked amongst themselves.
She doesn’t know that introverts can’t handle these sudden conversational passes.
My lack of social skills, honed from years of avoidance, comes out at times like these.
In a bad way, of course.
“…Uh, w-well… yes.”
As expected, my eyes darted around, I stumbled over my words, and mumbled.
Someone kill me.
“Are you really that close?”
Tachibana-san smiled faintly, the corners of her mouth lifting slightly.
She might be holding back laughter at my blunder.
“We are. We hang out a lot.”
“I see. So, Amatsuki-san, did you change your hairstyle because of Riri’s influence?”
Surprisingly, even Tachibana-san noticed the change in my appearance.
It was probably because Riri-chan was nearby, but I was still surprised.
“I don’t know about that, but I did tell her she’d look cuter if she changed it up. It suits you, doesn’t it?”
Ah… Riri-chan.
Why are you putting me in the spotlight even more?
Please don’t bring up such strange topics with Tachibana-san.
Riri-chan is being nice to me, so she says I’m cute, but…
Basically, no one cares about Amatsuki Suzuna.
It’s awkward being asked about the change in someone like that’s appearance.
“Yeah, I think it’s nice. I always thought of Amatsuki-san as the serious type, but with your hair down and no glasses, you look younger and cuter.”
Tachibana-san said something bizarre.
“See? Kaede thinks so too, Suzuna.”
“A-Ah… yeah. Thanks.”
Well, it’s probably just flattery.
Even Riri-chan said that friends flatter each other.
With someone she barely knows as a classmate, of course she would choose a safe, non-committal response.
“But Riri has a habit of forcing her opinions on others if she thinks she’s right. You should be careful, Amatsuki-san.”
“Hey, that’s mean.”
“It’s true, isn’t it?”
Tachibana-san chuckled pleasantly and then turned on her heel, leaving the classroom with the other girls.
Just as she appeared, she was a smart person.
“So, Suzuna?”
“So, what?”
Riri-chan asked me in a formal tone.
“Kaede didn’t say anything even after I told her we were friends, right?”
“…She did ask if we were ‘really that close.’”
“That’s because your reaction was so weak. She was normal after that, wasn’t she?”
“Well… yeah.”
It’s true that Tachibana-san didn’t say anything more about our relationship after that.
“See, you worry too much, Suzuna. People don’t care about me as much as you think.”
“…I wonder.”
“It’s true. So let’s be closer at school too.”
I wonder if it’s okay.
Wouldn’t people be jealous if I tried to step out of my usual role?
That worries me.
“Come on. School’s over, let’s go.”
Riri-chan took my hand and started walking.
…Since when?
At first, I tried to shake her hand off.
But now, I don’t feel like doing that at all.
When Riri-chan holds my hand, I don’t even feel like resisting.
I think I’m allowing Riri-chan to lead me.
I realized that it’s a fact I have to accept.
◇◇◇
“Hey, Suzuna. Are you free today?”
Riri-chan asked as we left the school gates.
“…Well, I guess I am.”
I don’t usually have anything to do.
I’m not in any clubs, I don’t have a part-time job, and I’m not devoted to Shindo Minato anymore.
Even when I go home, I just read manga and novels or play games.
“Do you want to come over to my place?”
“…Excuse me?”
I was so surprised that my voice cracked.
“What’s with that reaction? I didn’t say anything weird.”
“No, it’s just… that’s an important event.”
“Is… it?”
I’ve heard that line from Riri-chan before.
It’s an event in the original story, in the Hinase Riri route, after becoming close with Shindo Minato.
I never thought I’d hear that line directed at me.
Riri-chan is probably inviting me casually because we’re friends.
But the invitation was exactly the same as in the original story, so it startled me.
“It’s not out of your way, Suzuna, so what do you say?”
I know.
Riri-chan’s house is in a high-rise apartment in the center of town, in the downtown area.
That’s why she’s often seen there.
“…Okay. What are we going to do at your house?”
“Eh, what do you mean—”
Riri-chan furrowed her brow, as if she hadn’t thought about it.
“—Come to think of it, what do you usually do at home, Suzuna?”
Apparently, she’ll decide what to do based on my interests.
“…”
But it was hard to say.
Reading manga and novels or playing games…
It’s the epitome of being an introvert.
I acknowledge that I’m an introvert, but I don’t want to flaunt it.
I’ve resigned myself to the fact that there’s no point in hiding my introverted personality, but showing my introverted hobbies is a high hurdle.
Riri-chan probably wouldn’t understand.
“Why are you silent?”
“…I… watch movies and anime.”
I wasn’t lying.
Just being vague.
“Hmm, Western films?”
“…Japanese films.”
“What genre?”
“…I watch everything from romance to war movies.”
“I see.”
I wanted to end this topic.
I feel like I’ll only reveal more flaws if she keeps digging.
“What about you, Riri-chan? What do you do at home?”
“Hmm? Lately, I watch anime and online videos. I’m an otaku, so I do that kind of stuff a lot at home. I also watch movies and dramas.”
“H-Hmm…”
That’s… unfair…
Popular people can call themselves otaku without shame and enjoy those kinds of hobbies.
Or rather, if she watches movies and dramas too, she’s just a person with diverse interests.
And I’m sure she has many other hobbies.
I’m envious. It’s wholesome and aspirational.
Meanwhile, I enjoy my hobbies in secret, hiding in the shadows…
“Then tell me your favorite movies, Suzuna. We could watch one of those.”
“…Ah, okay, leave it to me.”
I’ve completely dug my own grave.
It’s not a hobby I can readily share.
My footsteps grew heavy due to my own blunder.
------------------ 
25 A Space for Two
“Wow.”
I stepped into a high-rise apartment building in a residential area of the downtown district.
Well, it’s Riri-chan’s home, but still.
After she let me in through the security entrance requiring a passcode, I couldn’t help but gasp in admiration.
“Ahh… ahaha. Yeah, it’s all thanks to my parents.”
Perhaps used to this reaction, Riri-chan gave a wry smile and led me inside.
The interior featured gleaming stone floors (marble, or something like that?), large windows, and calming wood-paneled walls.
The high ceilings further emphasized the luxurious atmosphere of the apartment.
“This way.”
I followed Riri-chan to the elevator.
We went up.
Stepping out into the hallway, the floor was softly lit with indirect lighting. Stylish.
“As expected, your environment shapes you…”
“What do you mean by that?”
“Beautiful people are born in beautiful places.”
“You’re saying weird things again, Suzuna.”
No, I’m being completely serious.
Riri-chan chuckled and stopped in front of a door.
Apparently, you need a key card to enter the apartment.
A beep sounded, and the lock disengaged.
“Go ahead.”
“Excuse me.”
I was led into the living room.
The view from the window overlooked almost all the surrounding buildings, and the sky felt close.
The predominantly white interior was simple and sophisticated.
“There’s nothing here, but have a seat.”
I sat down on the gray sofa in the center of the living room.
It was plush, with soft cushions.
But, as she said, the living room was simple.
Since there weren’t many things in the room, it might be more accurate to call it minimalist.
It was a stark contrast to Riri-chan’s flashy appearance.
“Where’s your room, Riri-chan?”
The living room wasn’t shown in the original game, so I didn’t know it was this minimalist.
But I know that Riri-chan’s room is as flashy as she is.
“Eh, you want to go in already?”
“Hmm? Is that not okay?”
Riri-chan’s voice was slightly high-pitched.
Was she not planning on letting me into her room?
The living room felt too sterile and impersonal, so I naturally wanted to see her room.
“I-It’s not that it’s not okay, but… I need to mentally prepare myself…”
“Mentally prepare…?”
What’s that supposed to mean?
She invited me to her house, and now she needs to mentally prepare to let me into her room?
“Riri-chan, don’t tell me your room is messy?”
Is it the “too messy to let anyone in” scenario?
“N-No way! I cleaned it! It might not be tidy, but…”
“Hmm. Then there’s no problem, right? Let’s go to your room.”
“Fine, but wait a minute. Can you drink tea, Suzuna?”
Apparently, Riri-chan was preparing tea.
“Yeah, I can.”
“Okay. Then I’ll go to my room first.”
I looked around the living room restlessly while listening to the sounds of Riri-chan pouring water.
No matter how many times I looked, it was a simple room.
It felt like she deliberately kept it bare.
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
I was led to Riri-chan’s room.
“Oh!”
It was exactly like the room in the game.
A black and white patterned carpet, a white low table, pink furniture and accessories, and a bed with black sheets.
It screamed “gal.”
It was so different from the living room and the rest of the apartment that it felt like I had stepped into another world.
“Hey, don’t stare so much. It’s embarrassing.”
“Really?”
“No one stares that much.”
I see.
I thought she’d be used to it, but apparently not.
I’ve never invited a friend to my room, so I can’t understand how she feels.
“Anyway, have a seat. Although there aren’t any chairs, so it’s either the bed or the floor.”
“Ah…”
I couldn’t bring myself to sit on Riri-chan’s bed.
I decided to sit on the carpet.
Right by the entrance, facing the bed.
“The bed is fine too, you know?”
“I’m good here.”
Saying “Okay,” Riri-chan took off her blazer and hung it on a hanger along with her ribbon.
It’s natural to dress casually at home, but Riri-chan in just her blouse seemed even more relaxed.
“I wonder if the water’s boiled. I’ll go check.”
“Okay.”
I was left alone in her room.
The room was filled with Riri-chan’s scent.
I hadn’t been consciously aware of it before, but I noticed it because she often hugs me.
A faint, sweet fragrance.
“I’m such a creep!”
I felt strangely excited.
Come to think of it, this is the first time we’ve been truly alone together.
We’ve been alone before, but it was always outside, at a cafe, or at school.
There was always the presence of others, but not in this space.
It was a space completely for the two of us, where I could hear nothing but the sounds Riri-chan made.
It made me feel more… giddy than usual.
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
Riri-chan returned a few minutes later.
She was carrying a tray with a tea set.
The scent of tea filled the room.
It smelled nice, but I also thought it was a shame that it was masking Riri-chan’s scent.
“Sorry, let me do everything.”
“It’s fine. You’re the guest, so relax.”
Riri-chan placed the tray on the low table.
…And that’s when it happened.
“Here you go.”
Riri-chan usually has the top two buttons of her blouse undone.
So when she bent down, there was a lot of… exposure.
I caught a glimpse of her black underwear and the white skin beneath.
“Th-Thanks.”
“…? You’re welcome.”
I felt like I had seen something I shouldn’t have and quickly averted my gaze.
I replied to avoid looking suspicious, but my voice cracked, betraying my flustered state.
This is strange.
Why am I reacting like this just from seeing a girl’s underwear?
Maybe I’m just nervous being in this space.
Tea and cookies were placed on the table.
“You can eat that.”
“Okay.”
I picked up a cookie and put it in my mouth, afraid that speaking would reveal my strange excitement.
A pleasant crunching sound.
“…So? Is it good?”
“Yeah.”
A creaking sound from the bed.
Riri-chan must have sat down on the bed.
Since I was looking down, I could only judge the situation from the sound.
“Really?”
“Y-Yeah.”
Honestly, I couldn’t taste anything.
It’s not that the cookies tasted bad, but I wasn’t in a state to appreciate the flavor.
“Suzuna, you’ve only been saying ‘yeah.’ Did you not like it?”
“N-No, that’s not true.”
“Then why are you looking down?”
It’s so Riri-chan wouldn’t notice how flustered I am.
But if I keep doing this, she’ll get suspicious.
So I lifted my head, trying to appear calm.
It’s okay, I just need to speak in my usual flat tone.
“It’s really delici—ah.”
“Hmm?”
Riri-chan’s skirt is always short.
Sitting on the bed, she didn’t seem to care and had her legs spread.
That’s normal.
Because this is Riri-chan’s room, and I’m the only one here.
But because of that, I could see her black underwear beneath her skirt.
From the top of her thighs inwards, a place I shouldn’t be able to see.
I didn’t know where to look and could only look down again.
“Eh… ah. A-Ahaha, sorry, sorry. I got a little too relaxed at home.”
She must have noticed my gaze and my reaction.
Riri-chan quickly closed her legs, and I heard a forced laugh.
But I know that I’m the strange one.
A normal person wouldn’t react like this.
“No, I’m the one who should apologize.”
“No, no, I’m the one who showed you something strange. Of course you’d be flustered.”
“No, it’s fine.”
“Oh, o-okay…”
Because of me, the atmosphere in the room had become awkward.
------------------ 
26 A Space for Two: Hinase Riri’s Side
O-Oh…
Suzuna… Suzuna is at my house.
It’s only natural since I invited her, but I’m overwhelmed with excitement and nervousness at the same time.
“Wow.”
Suzuna gasped as soon as she entered the entrance.
This apartment building is quite impressive, even in this area, so I guess it seems new to her.
“Ahh… ahaha. Yeah, it’s all thanks to my parents.”
But this isn’t my achievement; it’s thanks to my dad, who provides for us.
Dad provided a house that’s too grand for a high school girl living alone.
But this is the first time I’ve had a friend over, so I didn’t expect this reaction.
Suzuna looked around curiously.
Her gestures were somehow like a small animal, and it was cute.
“This way.”
Suzuna kept stopping to look around, so I called out to her and led the way.
And Suzuna obediently followed behind me, which was also cute.
“As expected, your environment shapes you…”
Suzuna muttered softly.
“What do you mean by that?”
“Beautiful people are born in beautiful places.”
“You’re saying weird things again, Suzuna.”
Suzuna usually doesn’t talk much, and then suddenly she says something unexpected.
And she says it with a straight face, so I know she’s not joking, which makes it even more embarrassing.
Suzuna tilted her head repeatedly, as if she didn’t understand what I said.
Airheads are so troublesome.
I took a breath and unlocked the door.
“Go ahead.”
“Excuse me.”
Suzuna entered the living room.
She continued to look around.
Suzuna usually doesn’t show much interest in anything.
So seeing her like this makes me happy, like she’s interested in me.
“There’s nothing here, but have a seat.”
I had Suzuna sit on the sofa and went to the kitchen to get the electric kettle.
“Where’s your room, Riri-chan?”
Just as I was thinking that, Suzuna suddenly expressed interest in my room.
Wait a minute.
“Eh, you want to go in already?”
“Hmm? Is that not okay?”
I’m already nervous enough having Suzuna in my apartment, let alone in my room.
“Riri-chan, don’t tell me your room is messy?”
“N-No way! I cleaned it! It might not be tidy, but…”
I only decided to invite Suzuna over a little while ago.
Once I decided to get closer to her, I’ve become surprisingly bold.
If I had planned this in advance, I would have tidied up a bit more, but since it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, it’s not perfect.
That made me even more nervous.
“Hmm. Then there’s no problem, right? Let’s go to your room.”
“Fine. But wait a minute, can you drink tea, Suzuna?”
“Yeah, I can.”
“Okay. Then to my room.”
I filled the electric kettle with water and turned it on.
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
I led her to my room.
“Oh!”
Suzuna gasped as soon as she saw the room.
Her reaction was clearly different from when she saw the entrance and the living room.
It sounded like a more… visceral surprise.
I wonder what it is. Is my room strange?
Does it not suit Suzuna’s taste?
…I’m a little scared to ask.
“Hey, don’t stare so much. It’s embarrassing.”
“Really?”
“No one stares that much.”
It feels like she’s seeing a part of me I don’t usually show, and it’s making me blush.
“Anyway, have a seat. Although there aren’t any chairs, so it’s either the bed or the floor.”
“Ah…”
Suzuna hesitated for a moment with a troubled expression.
But then she sat on the floor.
“The bed is fine too, you know?”
“I’m good here.”
I thought she might at least use the bed as a backrest, but…
Suzuna seemed to like that spot and didn’t move.
I took off my blazer and ribbon and hung them on a hanger to relax.
“I wonder if the water’s boiled. I’ll go check.”
“Okay.”
I left the room.
When I returned to the kitchen, the water had boiled.
I put tea leaves in the teapot and poured in the hot water.
After letting it steep, I poured the tea into teacups through a strainer.
“And this too.”
The cookies I baked today.
I actually thought about giving them to Suzuna at lunch, but I held back because giving her both a bento and cookies seemed like too much.
“I never thought things would turn out like this. I’m glad I made them.”
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but things are going well.
Suzuna is in my room, drinking tea I made, and eating cookies I baked.
It’s exciting.
It feels good, like a part of Suzuna is becoming a part of me.
Having Suzuna in my territory makes me feel nervous, but also safe.
I want to keep her here forever.
Suzuna is like a small animal, so I guess that’s how I feel.
I put the tea and cookies on a tray and carried it to my room.
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
When I returned to the room, Suzuna looked at me.
“Sorry, let me do everything.”
Suzuna apologized apologetically.
It made me happy. It was cute.
I felt a surge of protectiveness, wanting to hug her tightly.
“It’s fine. You’re the guest, so relax.”
But I hid my feelings and acted mature.
If I’m too aggressive, Suzuna will pull away, so I have to be careful.
“Here you go.”
I bent down and placed the tea and cookies on the low table.
“Th-Thanks.”
“…? You’re welcome.”
Suzuna’s voice sounded a little flustered.
I tried to look at her face, but she was looking down, so I couldn’t read her expression.
Oh well.
“You can eat that.”
“Okay.”
As soon as I said that, Suzuna quickly grabbed a cookie and put it in her mouth.
Is she unusually hungry…?
But I’m glad she ate it right away.
I’m curious about her opinion. I wonder if it suits her taste.
“…So? Is it good?”
“Yeah.”
I sat on the bed and watched Suzuna.
Suzuna was munching on the cookies, but her replies seemed absentminded.
“Really?”
“Uh, yeah.”
…Suspicious.
“Suzuna, you’ve only been saying ‘yeah.’ Did you not like it?”
“N-No, that’s not true.”
Even as she said that, her voice sounded like she was hiding something.
And Suzuna was still looking down.
I can’t tell what she’s thinking if she won’t show me her face.
“Then why are you looking down?”
When I asked that, Suzuna timidly looked up.
“It’s really delici—ah.”
Just as Suzuna looked up at me, she froze.
She wasn’t looking at my face, her gaze was fixed somewhere lower.
“Hmm?”
Suzuna blushed and quickly looked down again.
What happened…? I followed Suzuna’s gaze and realized that I had my legs spread a little too wide.
“Eh… ah. A-Ahaha, sorry, sorry. I got a little too relaxed at home.”
I quickly closed my legs.
Sh-She must have seen… right?
“No, I’m the one who should apologize.”
Suzuna nodded repeatedly, still looking down.
Suzuna definitely saw my underwear and panicked.
“No, no, I’m the one who showed you something strange. Of course you’d be flustered.”
“No, it’s fine.”
“Oh, o-okay…”
But wait a minute.
No girl would react like that just from seeing another girl’s underwear.
They’d usually laugh it off or not even care.
But Suzuna is looking down shyly, avoiding eye contact with me.
What does that mean?
Could it be… something more than just friends…?
N-No way, right? I can’t imagine Suzuna, with her cold demeanor, having those kinds of feelings for me.
But it bothers me.
I’m dying to know what Suzuna thinks of me.
------------------ 
27 Unspoken Words
What do I do, what do I do…?
My heart is pounding.
Riri-chan must have noticed.
She must think I’m weird.
“S-Suzuna…? What’s wrong? You seem strange.”
“I’m not strange, I’m just as usual.”
Ah, damn it.
We’re alone in Riri-chan’s room.
My flustered state is palpable.
I can’t hide it.
“I’m going home.”
This is no good.
I don’t know how to fix this awkward atmosphere.
The only solution I can think of is to run away.
I stood up.
“Eh, wait, Suzuna. That’s too sudden.”
“It’s not sudden. It’s enough.”
“No, you just got here. You haven’t finished your tea, and there are still cookies left.”
“I’m sorry for leaving them, but they were delicious.”
After saying that, I turned and reached for the doorknob.
“Hey, I’m not satisfied with that dismissive tone…!”
I tried to open the door, but I couldn’t.
Because Riri-chan grabbed my hand.
“Let go.”
Her tightly clasped fingers were hot.
Riri-chan’s fingertips, which I used to perceive as cold, were now quite warm.
“Then tell me why you’re leaving.”
“We’ve played enough, so I think it’s time to go.”
“That’s way too early. Tell me the truth.”
I can’t.
Who could say, “I got flustered after seeing your underwear, Riri-chan”?
Even I don’t understand why, and Riri-chan would be even more confused if I told her that.
“I’m telling the truth. It’s getting late, so I’m going home.”
“You weren’t talking about the time.”
“I am now.”
She wasn’t convinced at all.
Riri-chan is being forceful today.
I didn’t mind that, but that doesn’t mean I have to do everything she says.
I have the right to go home if I want to.
“That’s just an excuse. What happened?”
“You’re being persistent, Riri-chan. I’m going home.”
I pulled my arm, trying to escape Riri-chan’s grasp.
But sensing my resistance, Riri-chan’s grip tightened.
“Then at least look at me properly before you go—!”
She grabbed my shoulder.
I didn’t expect her to be so forceful, and I was easily pulled towards her.
Riri-chan was so close that I could almost hear her breathing.
“Ah… um…”
Our eyes met.
I couldn’t form any words.
I felt embarrassed and… confused.
I didn’t know what to do with these inexplicable feelings.
“Suzuna, you’ve been acting strange. Did I do something wrong?”
“You didn’t, it’s okay.”
“Then why are you saying you’re going home? Something happened, didn’t it?”
“Nothing happened, really. You’re overthinking it.”
Please, don’t try to pry into my feelings any further.
Even I don’t understand them, and if Riri-chan touches upon them, I’ll become even more confused.
“You always hide things, Suzuna. At least be honest with me.”
“I’m not hiding anything.”
“Lies, you always try to hide things like this, Suzuna. I know you.”
“You don’t know, you don’t understand me at all, Riri-chan.”
“—Ugh!”
Perhaps displeased by my words, Riri-chan closed the distance even further.
Since my hand was still in her grasp, I couldn’t run away, so I stepped back.
—Thud
My back hit the wall, and I had nowhere left to go.
There was no escape route, only Riri-chan in front of me.
The person who was currently disrupting my peace of mind the most was so close.
This is bad.
Just looking at her made it hard to breathe.
“…Stop… it. Being this close… is uncomfortable.”
“That’s because you won’t tell me the truth, Suzuna. I’ll let you go if you tell me.”
My eyes were drawn to the nape of Riri-chan’s neck, to the exposed skin above her open blouse.
The image from earlier flashed through my mind.
This is strange, this is so strange.
I want to look away, but I can’t because she’s right in front of me.
Well, then I can just close my eyes.
But I kept my eyes open, staring at Riri-chan’s chest.
It’s a contradiction.
My thoughts and actions are disjointed.
“Move away… Being this close… is uncomfortable.”
Even when I tried to escape, Riri-chan held me tighter, and I couldn’t move.
Her intertwined fingers were hot, yet soft.
I hated myself for even noticing such things.
“Why do you hate it so much? Tell me why.”
She keeps saying “Tell me,” “Tell me.”
I want to know! I want to know why it’s so hard to breathe.
“I don’t know, I don’t know!”
“Huh? What’s that? Do you think I’ll be satisfied with that?”
Riri-chan’s voice sharpened.
She thinks I’m trying to deceive her again.
But that’s not it.
“I’m telling you, I don’t know! Something strange happens when I look at you, Riri-chan. My thoughts and actions become jumbled, and I can’t breathe properly. That’s all!”
“—Eh?”
Her voice was filled with surprise.
The strength in her grip suddenly loosened.
I shook off her hand and finally grabbed the doorknob.
“So I’m going home. I’m going home because I feel like I’m going crazy if I stay here.”
“…Okay, I understand. I understand, Suzuna, so I won’t stop you anymore. But don’t run away like that, it makes me sad.”
Riri-chan’s voice suddenly softened.
Where did her forceful demeanor go? Now she looked dejected and troubled.
I don’t understand.
The person who kept demanding an explanation is now saying she’s sad.
Please stop, it’s messing with me.
“…I’m really going home.”
“I know. I’ll walk you out.”
“It’s unnecessary.”
“Just downstairs. You might get lost, Suzuna.”
Don’t underestimate me.
Even if it’s my first time here, an apartment building isn’t that complicated.
But Riri-chan seemed unwilling to compromise. She put on her blazer and started walking.
“Come on, you’re going home, right?”
“…Yeah.”
The person who was trying to stop me from leaving is now leading the way.
Riri-chan is truly incomprehensible.
◇◇◇
We walked down the hallway and got into the elevator.
The ride down felt strangely long, even though it was instantaneous on the way up.
It’s because of this silence.
That’s why I didn’t need her to walk me out.
Riri-chan came even though she knew it would create this awkward atmosphere.
Then she should at least say something.
“…Suzuna.”
As if answering my prayers, Riri-chan finally spoke.
“Yeah?”
“You… don’t hate me, do you?”
“…What’s with that question?”
I did want her to talk, but not about something that creates such an awkward atmosphere.
What is she going to do if I say I hate her?
“Well, you said you couldn’t breathe.”
“…I wouldn’t come to the house of someone I hate.”
“Right, of course.”
“Yeah, don’t say such weird things, we’re friends.”
“You’re right. We’re friends.”
Riri-chan nodded repeatedly.
The elevator finally reached the first floor.
We walked through the entrance and stepped outside.
“See you later.”
I tried to act normal and spoke curtly.
It felt too late, but I wanted to act like nothing happened, at least while leaving.
“Take care, Suzuna. Come over again.”
“Take care” would have been enough.
Why does Riri-chan always say things that suggest a continuation?
If I refuse, it’ll ruin the mood.
“…Yeah, see you later.”
But I responded to her words, accepting the connection.
I don’t want to ruin my relationship with Riri-chan, so I accept her invitation.
Being around Riri-chan makes me feel strange, but so does being away from her.
I think I’m falling apart somewhere.
28 The Student Council President Heroine Speaks Her Mind
In the morning, I opened the window, and the sunlight and gentle breeze caressed my cheeks.
I, Amatsuki Suzuna, started the day feeling refreshed—
“Not a chance…”
I quickly closed the window.
After checking the weather outside, it was blindingly bright and freezing cold. The worst.
I dove back into bed.
My mood was completely gloomy.
I knew the reason.
“I’m telling you, I don’t know! Something strange happens when I look at you, Riri-chan. My thoughts and actions become jumbled, and I can’t breathe properly. That’s all!”
Those were the words I blurted out at Riri-chan’s house.
“Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it…”
Looking back on it calmly after returning home, I could only cringe.
Why did I make such an abstract, clingy-sounding remark?
I was filled with doubt and self-loathing.
There were plenty of other scenes that made me want to bury my head in the sand.
Blushing just from seeing her underwear, becoming unable to speak properly, unable to make eye contact.
I knew I was socially inept, but I didn’t think I was that bad.
The more I replayed it in my mind, the more embarrassed I became.
My body started to heat up in a bad way, and I felt like I was going crazy, unable to process the embarrassment.
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
I buried my face in my pillow and screamed.
The pillow should muffle the sound, so I shouldn’t be disturbing the neighbors.
Anyway, this morning was the worst.
This is how dark history is made.
I couldn’t bring myself to go to school.
“Yeah, I’ll skip. It can’t be helped today. My mental state will collapse if I go.”
This is the world of a dating sim, after all.
I don’t care about Amatsuki Suzuna’s grades.
She might be a good student character, but I, who have already deviated from the route, don’t need to maintain that.
I’ll sleep. I’ll sleep and forget everything.
Hopefully, my memories will be erased, and I’ll be reborn somewhere new.
I pulled the covers over my head and closed my eyes, trying to suppress the unpleasant memories.
—Ping
…And yet, the dreaded notification sound from my messaging app rang out.
“I’m trying to sleep. I can’t sleep if there’s something bothering me.”
Cursing my timid self, I looked at my phone screen.
“Good morning. Sorry for the sudden invitation yesterday. But I had fun being with you, Suzuna. See you at school.”
It was a message from Riri-chan.
It was as if she knew I was planning to skip school.
And the last part, “See you at school,” bound me.
“…I guess I have no choice but to go.”
Skipping school already fills me with guilt, and I’m not strong enough to sleep soundly while ignoring a friend’s message.
Sighing at my own weakness, I got out of bed.
◇◇◇
“Good morning, Suzuna.”
“…”
“Hey, ignoring me is not allowed.”
“…Good morning.”
After leaving the house and passing through the downtown area, Riri-chan was waiting for me, as usual.
It’s becoming a regular occurrence, even though we’ve never made plans to meet.
“You’re late today. What were you doing?”
“…I was sleepy.”
“Oversleeping? Even you do that sometimes, Suzuna?”
…It’s mostly your fault, Riri-chan.
But she seemed cheerful and carefree, flashing a bright smile.
Her voice was also high-pitched, even for this early in the morning.
It was as if nothing had happened yesterday.
“Hey, you don’t have to wait for me.”
“Why? Let’s go to school together.”
“…No.”
I was about to say, “Because of appearances,” but then I remembered that excuse no longer applies.
Riri-chan taught me that I shouldn’t worry about walking next to her.
“Come on, let’s go.”
“Ah, okay…”
Riri-chan took my hand and led me to school.
It felt so… normal that even I reverted to my usual self.
◇◇◇
Arriving at school.
“Yo, Suzuna. Coming to school late again while hiding from me? Do you want my attention that much?”
The protagonist, looking smug, said something incredibly off the mark.
Lately, I’ve been preoccupied with the Riri-chan situation, but the main issue is this guy.
Shindo Minato.
The protagonist of this game has to end up with someone.
But for some reason, three of the heroines have currently achieved the impossible feat of avoiding his route.
I’m trying to figure out how to resolve this situation.
Otherwise, there’s a risk of being forced into the route where Shindo-kun and Amatsuki Suzuna get closer.
So I think.
How can I make the heroines fall for Shindo-kun?
“…But he’s a hopeless good-for-nothing, and they all fall for him anyway. I shouldn’t need to interfere…”
I sighed, not knowing what to do.
“Hey, did you just call me a good-for-nothing?”
“It’s okay, you’re popular even though you are one.”
“That’s not how it works! And retract the good-for-nothing comment!”
“…What should I do?”
“Hey, don’t ignore me!”
◇◇◇
The answer remained elusive as lunch break arrived.
“Suzuna, let’s eat.”
Riri-chan’s advance knows no bounds.
She came to my desk with a bento box.
“Th-Then… let’s go to the courtyard.”
“We can eat here, right?”
—Thud
She placed the bento box on my desk.
I felt an incredible amount of pressure.
“It’s cold today, and I don’t want to go outside every time. We can eat here, right?”
“A… okay.”
Defeated, I sat down obediently.
I heard the sound of the chair in front of me moving.
“Hinase-san, want to sit here? I’ll eat somewhere else.”
“Oh, really? Thanks.”
Shindo-kun gave up his seat, and Riri-chan sat down opposite me, using his chair.
…Such a bland conversation for a protagonist and a heroine.
There’s no romantic atmosphere at all.
Oh well. I’ve given up on the Riri-chan route.
“Riri-chan, are you sure you don’t want to eat with Tachibana-san and the others?”
“Yeah, I said I’d eat with Suzuna.”
“…Are you sure it’s okay?”
I thought she’d be excluded from the group if she acted like this.
“It’s fine. …But if you’re that worried, you can join us too, Suzuna.”
…No, there’s no way I can join that group.
“I’ll pass.”
“Cold. And the reason?”
“I don’t think I can become friends with anyone other than you, Riri-chan, and I don’t want to.”
That’s the truth.
Riri-chan is an exception. I’m not a sociable person.
“I-I see…”
“? Yeah.”
Riri-chan’s voice suddenly became faint.
The change in her tone was strange.
“So, look, I made extra for you, Suzuna.”
“Eh, I told you you didn’t have to…”
“It’s fine, it’s fine.”
As Riri-chan opened the bento box she brought—
“Excuse me, is Hinase Riri-san here?”
A dignified voice echoed through the noisy classroom.
The classroom fell silent instantly.
“Ah, she’s over there.”
One of my classmates pointed to where Riri-chan was sitting, which also meant pointing at me.
“Thank you.”
The girl entered the classroom briskly and stood in front of Riri-chan without hesitation.
A beautiful girl with long golden hair and slightly upturned eyes that gave her a cool impression.
I knew her well.
“Excuse me for interrupting your meal. Hinase-san, I believe you understand what I want to discuss.”
The girl stated matter-of-factly, her tone businesslike.
“Huh? I haven’t said anything, so how would I know?”
Riri-chan replied in a bored tone and with an equally bored expression, clearly annoyed.
“Is that so? Then allow me to be blunt, so even someone with a poor memory like you can understand. I’ve warned you repeatedly that the way you wear your uniform violates the school rules. Do you have any explanation?”
“Your way of speaking is annoying. And that wasn’t blunt at all.”
“Oh, I apologize. I didn’t realize you couldn’t even comprehend such simple Japanese.”
“…Are you picking a fight?”
I know this scenario too.
“You’re the one picking a fight. I’ve told you repeatedly that you’ll face severe consequences if you don’t change your attire.”
“Huh? Why should I listen to you?”
“You seem to be mistaken. This is simply one of the student council’s activities.”
“So the student council is a group of people with too much free time who nitpick about the length of a single student’s skirt?”
A heated exchange of words, the animosity between them was genuine.
“Watch your words. I, Kanaori Reika, will not tolerate such disparaging remarks about the student council.”
Yes, she’s Kanaori Reika, a second-year and the student council president.
One of the heroines.
------------------ 
29 Proof of Suspicion
“Now then, Hinase-san. I’d like to hear your answer. Will you correct your uniform to comply with the school rules?”
Kanaori Reika is the student council president.
In other words, the student council president heroine.
Her appearance, as in the original story, began with a conflict with Hinase Riri.
“I keep telling you, even the teachers haven’t said anything, so why should I listen to another student? It doesn’t make sense.”
“It doesn’t matter who points it out, these are the rules. As long as you’re enrolled at Seiran Academy, you have an obligation to follow them.”
Kanaori-san is right about this.
She’s just pointing it out according to the rules.
Riri-chan’s argument doesn’t hold water.
“…Can’t you speak normally? It’s tiring talking to you, like you’re a robot.”
But, as expected of Riri-chan.
She completely ignored the question and changed the subject entirely.
The student council president and a gal have fundamentally different ways of thinking.
Just look. Kanaori-san’s face twitched at Riri-chan’s attitude.
“You should be the one listening to what others are saying! I don’t understand why you dress so indecently every single day.”
“You should be the one to stop making a fuss about rules no one cares about!”
Oh… they’re talking, but they’re not communicating at all.
Can they really be this incompatible?
“This conversation is going nowhere. I’ll deal with you later. I have other business to attend to.”
“Just get out.”
“I am attending to it in this classroom.”
…Wait.
Hold on a minute.
There’s another character in this scene in the original story.
Shindo Minato.
In the original story, Kanaori Reika appears while Hinase Riri is trying to get Shindo Minato to eat her bento.
A similar exchange occurs, and Kanaori-san’s attention shifts to Shindo Minato.
“Shindo-san, excessive contact with the opposite sex on school grounds is a violation of school rules. Since I’ll be providing you with direct guidance, please come to the student council room immediately after school.”
Shindo Minato, surrounded by his childhood friend, his little sister, and a gal, ends up attracting the attention of the student council president.
But what about now?
Shindo Minato, of all people, gave up his seat to Hinase Riri and left the classroom.
In other words, he skipped the event with Kanaori Reika.
“Th-This is bad…”
I felt a cold sweat running down my back.
He skipped the encounter entirely.
There’s no way to manage the routes.
What’s going to happen now?
With Shindo Minato gone, who will Kanaori Reika reprimand?
“You’re Amatsuki Suzuna-san, correct?”
“…Uh, y-yes.”
Kanaori-san looked at me with a forced smile.
What is this?
I’m wearing my uniform properly, and I’m not wearing any makeup.
I shouldn’t have broken any rules.
“I’ve noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time with Hinase-san after school recently.”
“Well, yeah…”
How does Kanaori-san know that?
…She was probably observing Riri-chan, her target, and I happened to be with her.
That must be it.
“Amatsuki Suzuna-san, loitering after school is a violation of school rules—”
Wait a minute.
This phrasing sounds incredibly familiar.
That’s… the line she’s supposed to say to the protagonist, isn’t it?
I must be imagining things.
“—Since I’ll be providing you with direct guidance, please come to the student council room immediately after school.”
It’s over.
That line is for Shindo Minato.
Why is she saying it to me?
What’s happening with this game?
“I didn’t hear a response, Amatsuki-san.”
“…Yes.”
My vision darkened.
“W-Wait, Suzuna?! Your face is pale! What’s wrong?!”
“I-It’s nothing…”
“Hey, Kanaori, what did you do to Suzuna?! She’s sensitive, so be more careful with your words!!”
“Eh?! I didn’t think I said anything that bad…”
This is no good.
It’s over before I even encountered the heroine.
This is the worst possible development.
And I’m going to be scolded by Kanaori-san.
One bad thing after another, my heart was completely clouded over.
◇◇◇
After school, I had to go to the student council room.
But that’s not supposed to be my role.
“Alright, let’s go home, Suzuna.”
…This carefree protagonist, Shindo Minato, who keeps inviting me even after being repeatedly rejected, was supposed to go.
I wondered what to do, and then it hit me.
“Yeah, okay.”
“Oh, it’s been a while. The loser of rock-paper-scissors carries the bags.”
…Is he serious?
“No, before that, let’s go to the student council room.”
“Eh, why?”
That’s right.
If he won’t go, then I’ll go.
I’ll bring Shindo Minato and Kanaori Reika together and advance their relationship.
That will solve everything!
“I was called by Kanaori-san.”
“Ugh. Kanaori-san is beautiful, but she’s also known for being strict… I think they call her ‘Ice Queen Kanaori’ or something.”
…I think I’ve heard that nickname before… or maybe not.
“That’s right. Come on, let’s go.”
“No way, I’m not going. Why would I go to the student council president when I wasn’t even called?”
“It’s fine because I called you.”
“Sorry, but there’s a huge power difference between you, Suzuna, and Kanaori-san. She’ll just ignore your invitation.”
“No, this is fate.”
“That’s a bit dramatic.”
Agh, seriously!
He won’t come quietly, and he won’t believe me even if I tell him the truth.
What am I supposed to do?
“Anyway, I’m passing this time. Good luck, Suzuna.”
“H-Hey…”
Shindo-kun bolted out of the classroom like a rabbit.
He’s so heartless, even though he’s my childhood friend.
“…Suzuna.”
Then, Riri-chan called out to me.
Is she… going with me?
Riri-chan is kind, so she must be worried about me.
“Riri-chan, I’m going to the student council room now…”
“What was that about just now?”
“Eh?”
Riri-chan’s voice was lower than I expected.
“Why did you invite Shindo?”
“…Uh, th-that’s…”
I can’t say it’s for the Kanaori route.
“You said you and Shindo were over, Suzuna.”
“Ah, of course we are.”
I’ve explained many times that Shindo-kun is in the past.
But Riri-chan was radiating a scary aura.
“Then why did you invite him?”
“Well, it was… just the flow of the conversation…”
“You invite a guy you used to like just because of the ‘flow of the conversation’? That doesn’t make sense.”
“Riri…-chan?”
Riri-chan was trying to suppress something, but it was overflowing.
Something like… dark emotions.
That scares me.
“…Sorry, it’s nothing. I’m going home.”
“Eh…”
Riri-chan, who always invites me, is going home first.
That alone was enough to make me feel a sense of loss.
“W-Wait…”
I chased after Riri-chan, who had already left.
She was fast, and by the time I caught up, she was already going down a deserted staircase.
“Riri-chan, wait!”
I grabbed Riri-chan’s hand from behind.
I finally caught her.
“…What’s wrong? You’re out of breath.”
“Why did you leave without me?”
“It’s fine for me to go home first sometimes. You’re going to the student council room, right, Suzuna?”
“…Yeah, but you’re being cold, Riri-chan.”
“Of course I am. You’re still relying on Shindo more than me, aren’t you, Suzuna?”
“Eh…?”
So that’s how Riri-chan interpreted our earlier exchange.
“That’s why I’m annoyed. If you like Shindo that much, then do whatever you want.”
“…I told you that’s not true.”
“That’s how it looked.”
I admit I wasn’t considerate enough.
But I don’t want Riri-chan to think that way about me.
I thought Riri-chan would understand me.
But I was being arrogant, and I realized that for the first time.
“That’s not true. You’re the only one I rely on, Riri-chan, so don’t say that.”
“You haven’t been acting like it.”
“Then… what do I have to do to make you believe me?”
I can’t tell her everything.
Even if I did, she wouldn’t believe me.
So I don’t know what else to do.
Riri-chan looked directly at me, as if answering my question.
“Then kiss me.”
“…Excuse me?”
Did I… mishear her?
“I’ll believe you if you kiss me.”
I know.
I know that Riri-chan would never say something like that to me, even as a joke.
30 A Kiss for the Heroine
“Riri-chan, what do you mean by that…?”
Riri-chan suddenly started saying strange things out of the blue.
Kissing isn’t something you’d hear in a normal conversation.
“You haven’t done that with Shindo, have you?”
“O-Of course not!”
Naturally, Amatsuki Suzuna, who isn’t on his route, is pure and innocent.
That being said, I, Yukitsuki Mashiro, also have no such experience, so even being asked so suddenly fills me with resistance.
“So we’ll kiss. Then I’ll believe that I’m more important to you than Shindo.”
“But why… k-kiss…?”
Saying the word “kiss” out loud is incredibly embarrassing.
And what’s with Riri-chan saying it with a straight face?
“If we don’t have physical contact, I feel like you’ll just deceive me with convenient words.”
“But even so… isn’t that going too far?”
It feels like we’re getting too close, physically.
I don’t think that’s an appropriate level of intimacy for friends.
“Aren’t you overthinking it? It’s normal for girls to kiss each other.”
“I-Is that so…”
Is it normal? Really?
Am I overthinking it…?
Maybe some girls do casually kiss each other.
As a friendly gesture, without any special meaning.
Maybe Riri-chan is that type of person.
“…But I still don’t think that’s proof of anything.”
I thought about it, but it still felt strange.
I don’t think it explains anything.
“…So you can’t do it. That’s how much I mean to you.”
Riri-chan turned away.
She seemed to consider the conversation over and started down the stairs again.
That’s no good.
“Wait, don’t go.”
I grabbed Riri-chan’s arm tightly and stopped her on the landing.
“…Do you know that I would have already left if it wasn’t for you, Suzuna?”
“Either prove it or let go of my hand.”
That’s what Riri-chan wants to say, I think.
Her cold words made my heart freeze, but I know that letting her go now would hurt even more.
So even if it doesn’t make sense to me, I should do it if it will convince Riri-chan.
“Okay, if I do it… you’ll believe me…?”
“Yes, if you’re serious, Suzuna.”
She sounded like she was testing me.
Riri-chan usually takes the lead in everything, but this time, I have to make the first move.
It’s not something I’m used to, but I feel like I can endure it for Riri-chan’s sake.
“I-I’m really… going to do it…?”
My throat was dry.
I was so nervous that I felt like all the moisture in my body had evaporated.
My body felt numb, like it wasn’t mine, as I moved closer to Riri-chan.
“Yeah.”
Riri-chan closed her eyes.
Looking at her face up close like this, she was truly beautiful.
Her eyelashes were long, her nose was well-defined, and her lips were full and rosy.
Her slender neck had fair skin that made me want to… bite it.
I hesitated, wondering if I was even allowed to touch someone so beautiful.
“…Um.”
What am I supposed to do with my hands?
Should I just let them hang, or should I touch her face?
I felt like both were wrong, and in my hesitation, I touched Riri-chan’s shoulder.
“Nn…”
Riri-chan’s body flinched, surprised by my touch.
Her reaction was cuter than I expected, and my nervousness eased slightly.
Riri-chan’s cheeks seemed slightly flushed.
“Riri-chan, are you nervous…?”
“O-Of course I am. This is my first time.”
“…?!”
H-Hey…
Riri-chan, that’s not what you said.
Earlier, you said it was normal for girls to kiss each other.
But it’s different if it’s both of our first times.
It feels like we’ve stepped into forbidden territory.
That brought back my nervousness.
But Riri-chan wanted me to prove it to her this much.
So I want to respond to her feelings.
I moved my face closer.
Close enough that our noses touched, our bodies brushing against each other.
Her warmth seeped into me, making my head spin.
“…Riri-chan.”
“…Suzuna.”
Calling each other’s names was like a signal.
I steeled my resolve and kissed her.
A soft, moist, and supple sensation transmitted through my lips.
It was a new sensation, too stimulating for me to fully process.
I pulled away with a soft, wet sound.
“…Suzuna?”
“I-I did it. So… you believe me now, right?”
I let go of her shoulder and quickly distanced myself.
My gaze was fixed on the floor, unable to look directly at Riri-chan.
I wanted to be praised for staying here after doing something so embarrassing.
I actually wanted to run away right now.
But I want Riri-chan to trust me, so I’m enduring it.
“W-Well, you did it, but…”
“What? Do you have a complaint? You can’t, it’s a kiss, a kiss! The kiss you wanted!”
My racing mind sputtered nonsense.
A mix of nervousness and embarrassment made my body burn.
“That’s true, but… why… my cheek?”
I did kiss her.
On her cheek, though.
“I-It’s fine! A kiss is a kiss. I didn’t say it had to be mouth-to-mouth!”
That would be impossible.
Kissing on the lips is way too much.
If I did that, I’d be so embarrassed that I’d probably melt.
“…Well, whatever. You tried your best, Suzuna.”
Hearing those words, the tension drained from my body.
Good, the gentleness has returned to Riri-chan’s voice.
I think part of my nervousness was the fear of being rejected by Riri-chan.
I’m relieved that things are back to normal.
“Suzuna, aren’t you going to look up?”
“No, I don’t want to right now.”
I don’t know how to face Riri-chan right now.
If I look at her now, I’ll probably explode from embarrassment.
So I want to stay silent.
“I see. Then it’s my turn.”
—Tap
A light footstep, like she was dancing.
Riri-chan’s presence drew closer, and I felt a gentle breeze.
Then, a soft sensation lingered on my cheek.
Along with a faint, sweet fragrance.
“Eh, eh, ehh…?”
Even though it was my first time, I knew immediately what it was.
Because it was exactly what I had just done to Riri-chan.
I looked up reflexively, and Riri-chan, blushing slightly, grinned.
“I can’t let you be the only one to kiss, Suzuna. I have to return the favor.”
Riri-chan put her index finger to her lips and winked.
◇◇◇
Kissing between girls.
It’s just a light greeting, a touch of lips against each other’s cheeks.
But for me, it was the most heart-pounding experience.
------------------ 
31 Maintaining Order in the School
“Th-This is… I don’t understand. I didn’t know you were going to do it too, Riri-chan!”
I kissed her cheek, and she kissed mine.
I never imagined this would happen, and I couldn’t hide my confusion.
“It would be unfair to only let Suzuna do it.”
I didn’t ask for anything in return.
I wonder if this is really a platonic relationship.
“I’m not doing it again! This is a one-time thing!”
“Eh? Why? It’s fine.”
“It’s not fine! I’ve never heard of friends who do this all the time.”
“We’re… that kind of relationship.”
“That’s… suggestive. Just say we’re normal friends.”
Riri-chan giggled, watching me flustered.
I think she’s teasing me, enjoying my reaction.
She’s a bad person.
◇◇◇
“—Ah, you two…”
A cold voice came from the top of the stairs.
“Ugh, it’s Kanaori.”
The student council president, Kanaori Reika, looked down at us, her golden hair swaying.
Her gaze was much sharper than during lunch break.
…I have a bad feeling about this.
“I came looking for you because Amatsuki-san wasn’t coming, and…”
“K-Kanaori-san! Th-This is…”
I tried to explain—
“Both of you, come to the student council room immediately.”
—But Kanaori-san cut me off with her cold voice.
“Why do I have to go too? Only Suzuna was called by the student council.”
Riri-chan, still unaware of the situation, complained.
While I admire her spirit, that probably won’t work with Kanaori-san right now.
“Just be quiet and come.”
She replied sharply, not allowing any backtalk.
Kanaori-san turned and walked away, her shoulders squared.
“Huh? What’s with her? So annoying.”
“W-Well… I think we’re also at fault…”
Riri-chan, pouting, looked cute, but this wasn’t the time for that.
If we don’t hurry to the student council room, I’ll be the target of her attention.
That’s supposed to be Shindo Minato’s role in the original story.
“Ugh, that’s so annoying. I was finally feeling happy, and then she shows up. This is the worst.”
Riri-chan grumbled as she went up the stairs.
“? Riri-chan, you’re surprisingly obedient about going to the student council room.”
Knowing her, I thought she’d say something like,
“There’s no rule against students having free time, is there?”
And completely ignore her.
Riri-chan turned and looked at me.
“Hmm? Well, it’s okay since Suzuna’s with me.”
“Oh, I see…”
As expected of Riri-chan.
She was about to leave me behind just now, but now that we’ve made up, she’s back to her usual self.
A gal who lives by her feelings and a student council president who lives by the rules.
I can’t imagine them getting along…
◇◇◇
The student council room.
Crimson carpet, heavy wooden furniture, and a high-quality sofa in the center.
And a blonde girl sitting at a majestic desk with a large window behind her.
—Why is only the student council room so extravagant?
Well, I shouldn’t say such trivial things.
It’s a common trope in these kinds of worlds for the student council room to be unusually lavish, even if the rest of the school is ordinary.
“You finally arrived.”
Kanaori-san sighed and greeted us.
“You’re the one who called us. Get on with it.”
Riri-chan, seemingly displeased with Kanaori-san’s attitude, was being prickly.
Please don’t make things worse.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it? It’s about the indecent act you two were just engaged in.”
“…What are you talking about?”
Riri-chan tilted her head, feigning ignorance.
“It’s no use playing dumb! I saw it with my own eyes!”
“So, what did you see?”
“W-Well… on the stair landing, y-you… k-k-k…”
“Huh?”
…Um.
Does Riri-chan know what she’s doing?
And Kanaori-san’s hesitant attitude…
It’s innocent.
I understand. It’s embarrassing to say it out loud.
“I saw you… kissing… with my own eyes!”
Kanaori-san stood up, slamming her hand on the desk.
Her face was bright red.
I understand. It’s embarrassing.
And this student council president is a pure, innocent character.
“…So?”
“I can’t overlook such disruptive behavior on school grounds! What were you thinking?!”
“…Kanaori, how old are you?”
“We’re the same age! You know that, so don’t ask!”
“That’s why I’m asking. Even if we were actually kissing, which we weren’t, it’s not something you should be reprimanding us for. It doesn’t make sense.”
No, it makes sense, Riri-chan.
“And on the stair landing, a place where anyone could see… are you exhibitionists?!”
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…
We really did something inappropriate.
I was desperate.
We won’t do it again, so please forgive us.
“Hey, it was just a peck on the cheek.”
“That’s not the point!”
“Then what is the point?”
“The point is that engaging in such sexual activity on school grounds is inappropriate!”
“That’s an exaggeration…”
Riri-chan sighed at Kanaori-san’s outburst.
Neither of them seemed willing to back down.
“Are you denying it?”
“If we were a boy and a girl, it might be seen that way, but we’re both girls.”
Riri-chan is saying that it wasn’t sexual, just a lighthearted gesture of affection.
“That’s an outdated way of thinking. In this modern age of diversity, there’s nothing wrong with same-sex relationships.”
But Kanaori-san denied it with a straight face.
I understand what she’s trying to say, but…
“Same-sex relationships… you’re the one being suggestive.”
“?! Why would you say that?!”
“You thought we were doing something indecent, even though it was just a kiss between girls. That kind of thinking is suggestive.”
“D-Don’t be ridiculous! You two were kissing in such a sentimental atmosphere, and now you’re trying to make excuses?!”
“Don’t explain it! You’re crazy!”
The more they talked, the more suggestive the topic became, and both of their faces were flushed with embarrassment.
Neither of them seemed willing to back down, but every time they repeated their arguments, it came back to the kiss, creating a vicious cycle.
Even I’m embarrassed listening to them, so I wish they’d just stop.
“Please have some consideration for me, the one who has to reprimand you!”
“I didn’t ask you to!”
“Then you should refrain from such behavior in public!”
“We didn’t do anything weird!”
The conversation was going in circles.
And I haven’t even said a word since we entered the student council room.
“Um… Kanaori-san. I’m reflecting on what happened on the stairs. We won’t do it again, so please forgive us.”
“Suzuna! What do you mean, ‘we won’t do it again’?!”
Please, Riri-chan, just be quiet…
“Very well. Then I won’t pursue this matter any further. Hinase-san, you may leave.”
“That was quick.”
I think even Kanaori-san was embarrassed and wanted to end the conversation.
I wish Riri-chan would just take the hint.
“I have something to discuss with Amatsuki-san. Hinase-san, you are dismissed.”
Riri-chan seemed dissatisfied, but I made eye contact with her, assuring her that it was okay.
“…Fine, fine, I understand. Suzuna, I’ll be waiting for you at the entrance.”
“Ah, okay.”
Riri-chan reluctantly left the student council room.
Now it was just Kanaori-san and me.
32 Where the Heart Lies: Hinase Riri’s Side
I left the dreadful student council room and headed for the entrance.
I went down the deserted stairs and stopped on the landing.
This is where Suzuna kissed me just now.
“Suzuna…”
I called her name, even though I knew she wasn’t there.
Suzuna never showed any interest in me and was always dismissive.
But lately, she’s been changing.
For some reason, she’s starting to show interest in me.
I clearly felt it when I invited her to my house.
Suzuna blushed and panicked just from seeing my underwear.
She tried to leave, which is typical of her, but when I tried to stop her—
“I’m telling you, I don’t know! Something strange happens when I look at you, Riri-chan. My thoughts and actions become jumbled, and I can’t breathe properly. That’s all!”
—She said that.
I believe those words came from a place of affection, however small.
So, in that sense, I’m happy.
But are those feelings really just as a friend?
Lately, Suzuna has been acting strangely suspicious.
“…No, I’m just getting my hopes up.”
If anything, I’m the strange one, not Suzuna.
Lately, I can’t even control myself.
Suddenly inviting her to my house was one thing, but…
More than anything, I get incredibly irritated when someone gets close to Suzuna.
◇◇◇
It started when Shindo Kokona started making bentos.
The thought of Suzuna eating food made by another girl made my stomach churn.
I couldn’t stand the thought of Suzuna being… tainted by another girl.
So I’ve been feeding Suzuna my bento to prevent her from being taken away.
Even in class, Suzuna tried to distance herself, but I forcefully closed the gap.
But are these the feelings you have for a friend?
If I had to name these feelings, they would be “jealousy” and “possessiveness.”
…Well, it’s not like I don’t feel these emotions towards others.
I sometimes feel jealous of Kaede, who manages to get away with wearing flashy clothes without getting reprimanded. She’s good at navigating the world.
But the amount I feel towards Suzuna is incomparable.
I feel like I’m going crazy, consumed by these emotions.
That’s why I was so anxious when Shindo Minato spoke to Suzuna after school.
“Alright, let’s go home, Suzuna.”
The boy Suzuna used to like.
Knowing that, it shouldn’t feel good to even hear him casually invite her to go home with him.
Even seeing them casually talking to each other makes me uneasy, considering how much Suzuna likes being alone.
“No, before that, let’s go to the student council room.”
I couldn’t believe my ears.
Suzuna didn’t refuse; she even invited him to go to the student council room with her.
Why?
She should know that the Kanaori situation is troublesome. And inviting him means she relies on him, trusts him.
“No way, I’m not going. Why would I go to the student council president when I wasn’t even called?”
“It’s fine because I called you.”
“Sorry, but there’s a huge power difference between you, Suzuna, and Kanaori-san. She’ll just ignore your invitation.”
“No, this is fate.”
“That’s a bit dramatic.”
I’ve never seen Suzuna so insistent.
I’m always the one inviting her; I’ve never seen her invite someone so persistently.
And she even said “fate.”
Would she use the word “fate” with a boy she used to like?
I started to suspect that Suzuna still liked Shindo, even if she didn’t say it.
Anyone would think so.
“Anyway, I’m passing this time. Good luck, Suzuna.”
“H-Hey…”
Suzuna sounded clearly disappointed when Shindo refused.
Why?
Was she that eager to go with him?
She ignores me, but that guy is better?
Not a friend, not a boyfriend, just a childhood friend.
Does she think I’m beneath him?
If so, I’m shocked.
My “jealousy” escalated into “anger.”
“Why did you invite Shindo?”
“…Uh, th-that’s…”
“You said you and Shindo were over, Suzuna.”
“Ah, of course we are.”
“Then why did you invite him?”
“Well, it was… just the flow of the conversation…”
Suzuna only gave vague answers.
It was obvious she was hiding something.
So I thought she was still hiding her feelings for Shindo.
Thinking that, I almost lashed out at Suzuna.
But that’s strange.
Even if Suzuna still likes Shindo, what’s wrong with that?
It’s Suzuna’s choice who she likes.
It’s crazy to be angry about that.
I know that. I know it logically.
But my emotions aren’t catching up.
“…Sorry, it’s nothing. I’m going home.”
So I had to leave.
If I stayed any longer, I would definitely say something hurtful to Suzuna.
I don’t want to do that.
I don’t want Suzuna to hate me, and I don’t want to do anything that would make her hate me.
So I had no choice but to suppress these feelings and disappear.
My anger propelled me forward, and I headed for the entrance.
“Riri-chan, wait!”
But Suzuna came after me.
Suzuna took my hand.
I’m always the one chasing her, but Suzuna chased after me.
That alone shook me to my core.
But it’s not enough.
It’s not enough to make up for it.
I want proof that Suzuna needs me more.
“Then… what do I have to do to make you believe me?”
To Suzuna, seeking an answer, I demanded a kiss.
Because words aren’t enough anymore.
They can’t fill the void in my heart.
I wanted something more direct.
“I-I’m really… going to do it…?”
“Yeah.”
And Suzuna responded.
A kiss on the cheek is cute, but it felt much more real than words.
So I decided to respond to Suzuna and kissed her in the same way.
…No, that might be a lie.
I actually wanted to kiss Suzuna and make her mine.
I think those feelings were mixed in as well.
I had Suzuna do something she’s never done before, and I did it too.
That makes us special to each other.
Then Suzuna will be mine.
That’s how I felt.
◇◇◇
Lost in thought, I arrived at the entrance.
I leaned against the wall and waited for Suzuna.
Since I was waiting for Suzuna, my thoughts naturally turned to her.
—So why am I so jealous of Suzuna and trying to become “special” to her?
The question is where those feelings come from.
…No, I already know.
“That’s an outdated way of thinking. In this modern age of diversity, there’s nothing wrong with same-sex relationships.”
I never thought I’d get a hint from Kanaori, of all people.
So that must be it.
I think… I’ve fallen in love with Amatsuki Suzuna.
That’s why I’m so jealous, why I want to monopolize her, why I want to be special to her.
A simple answer that explains my feelings.
But I’m resistant to admitting it.
I somehow believed that I would fall in love with a boy someday.
But Kanaori shattered that belief, and it finally clicked.
It’s annoying that she was the one who made me realize it, but considering how much trouble she usually causes, I guess it’s fine if she’s useful for once.
“Ah, Riri-chan, I’m sorry for making you wait.”
Suzuna finally arrived.
Seeing her running towards me, as if she didn’t want to keep me waiting, made me happy.
Such a small thing makes my heart race.
Knowing that these feelings are love, my heart started to stir even more.
“I wasn’t waiting that long. But if you’re that sorry, you can make up for it with a kiss.”
“I told you, I’m not doing that anymore.”
“Stingy.”
“I’m not stingy.”
But I don’t have the courage to confess my feelings yet.
Just because Suzuna thinks I’m special doesn’t mean it’s love.
The thought of confessing my feelings unilaterally and ruining our relationship scares me.
So—
“Then how about holding hands?”
“That’s embarrassing, it’s weird.”
“It’s fine if no one’s around, right?”
“…Well, if no one’s around…”
—For now, I want to maintain this comfortable distance.
Because that alone makes me happy.
------------------ 
33 The Student Council President Is a Worrywart
“Now, there’s a reason why I called you here.”
“Sigh…”
Alone with Kanaori-san in the student council room.
I had a pretty good idea of how this conversation would go…
I was hoping I was wrong, though.
“Amatsuki-san, if I recall correctly, you used to wear your hair in pigtails and glasses.”
“That’s correct, but…”
As expected of the student council president.
She has incredible observation and memory skills to remember such an unremarkable student.
“I believe you’ve had that style since your first year, so why have you recently started wearing your hair straight and contacts?”
“Well… it was just… a change of pace, I guess…”
Ah, I have a bad feeling about this.
“It wasn’t Hinase Riri’s influence, was it?”
“…What do you mean?”
“There’s nothing wrong with your current appearance according to the school rules. However, I’m concerned about the cause of this change.”
“Are you saying it has something to do with Riri-chan?”
“Can you deny it? I know you’ve recently become close with Hinase Riri. She attracts attention, for better or worse, so information naturally gathers around her. And you changed your appearance around the same time.”
“…What are you trying to say?”
Ah, this pattern.
It’s completely… the same as what she was supposed to do with Shindo Minato.
“I’m worried that you’re being negatively influenced by her.”
As expected. Of course. This is what happens.
In the original story, the flow was like this:
…The target of her reprimand has completely shifted to me.
But I never thought I, who’s supposed to be upholding school order, would be on the receiving end of Kanaori-san’s scrutiny.
How can I get Kanaori-san to focus on Shindo-kun instead of me?
“N-No, that’s not true. It was just… a change of pace…”
“People are influenced by others. And in your case, it’s clear that Hinase Riri is that influence.”
“…Why are you assuming that when I’m denying it?”
“People often have difficulty understanding themselves. And Hinase-san’s attire violates school rules and is frivolous. I don’t want you to be influenced by that any further.”
“…Thank you… for your concern.”
It’s more trouble than it’s worth.
“I don’t understand why a serious and exemplary student like you would associate with someone so unreasonable. But I think you should choose your friends wisely.”
“…”
I understand that Kanaori-san is saying this out of goodwill.
From her perspective, she’s just doing what she’s supposed to, and she’s not saying anything particularly unreasonable.
I also know that in the original story, this is how she interacts with Shindo-kun, gradually getting closer to him.
But I can’t help but feel uncomfortable hearing her unilaterally disparage Riri-chan.
“Hinase-san’s grades are far from commendable. If your grades were to drop at this time—”
“Kanaori-san.”
I couldn’t listen any longer and interrupted her.
“—Yes?”
“…Please… don’t badmouth Riri-chan.”
“But Hinase-san is hardly an exemplary student…”
“Riri-chan isn’t a bad person like you think she is.”
“I understand that you’re offended by my remarks about your friend. However…”
This is no good.
I don’t want to hear any more.
I don’t want to hear any more bad things about Riri-chan.
“Her clothes might be… sloppy, but Riri-chan is a good person. You don’t understand that, Kanaori-san.”
“No, people with sloppy attire also have sloppy lifestyles.”
“I think you’re a little too rigid, Kanaori-san.”
“M-Me?!”
“Yes, what’s wrong with a slightly shorter skirt?”
“That’s not all. Wearing makeup at school is also prohibited…”
“Other people do it too. It’s just a matter of how much they wear.”
“But rules are rules.”
“Kanaori-san, if you’re going to talk about this modern age of diversity, then freedom of dress should also be recognized!”
“W-Well…”
I used Kanaori-san’s own words against her.
It’s a bit of a sneaky tactic, and it might be unfair considering her position as student council president.
But I couldn’t just agree with her.
“Anyway, I haven’t done anything wrong, so there’s no need for us to continue this conversation, is there?”
Since it seemed like it would just become a pointless argument, I turned to leave.
“Wait! I’m worried about you…”
“Then your worry is unnecessary. I can live a virtuous life.”
“Says the person who kisses in public…!”
“I-I’ve reflected on that!”
I left the student council room, feeling Kanaori-san’s piercing gaze on my back.
◇◇◇
—Click
I closed the heavy door of the student council room.
That took longer than I expected.
But I’m relieved that it’s finally over… or is it?
I’m still being targeted by Kanaori-san, aren’t I?
…What should I do?
Can I still get Kanaori-san to focus on Shindo-kun from here?
“Wait, I can’t. I’m keeping Riri-chan waiting.”
I hurried towards the entrance.
◇◇◇
“Ah, Riri-chan, I’m sorry. I kept you waiting, didn’t I?”
When I arrived at the entrance, Riri-chan was leaning against the wall in the hallway.
Hearing my voice, she pushed herself off the wall and turned around.
“I wasn’t waiting that long. But if you’re that sorry, you can make up for it with a kiss.”
And she said something ridiculous again.
Didn’t we just talk about not kissing anymore, especially after what Kanaori-san said?
“I told you, I’m not doing that anymore.”
“Stingy.”
“I’m not stingy.”
I’m going to live a virtuous life.
So Kanaori-san won’t reprimand me again.
And so she’ll reprimand Shindo-kun instead.
“Then how about holding hands?”
“That’s embarrassing, it’s weird.”
“It’s fine if no one’s around, right?”
…Holding hands… is that okay?
Yeah, that’s definitely not indecent.
And it’s not embarrassing if no one’s around.
“…Well, if no one’s around…”
“Ehehe. Yay!”
Riri-chan smiled happily, even at something like this.
◇◇◇
We left the school and walked through a quiet residential area.
“Here, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan reached out her hand.
“…Okay.”
I hesitated slightly, but then I took her hand.
Riri-chan’s hand was a little bigger than mine.
But her fingers were slender and soft, enveloping mine.
“Your hands are always warm, Suzuna.”
“Your hands are still a little cold, Riri-chan.”
Apparently, I have a higher body temperature.
34 Seeking What’s Missing
“Hey, Riri-chan.”
During our morning commute to school, which had become a routine, I decided to ask a question that had suddenly come to mind.
“What is it, Suzuna?”
“Have you always been like that with Kanaori-san?”
“…What about Kanaori?”
Riri-chan’s expression immediately soured at the mention of her name.
“Well, I was just wondering if you’ve always been on such bad terms…”
“Pretty much. I seem to be a thorn in her side. I might be breaking the rules, but there are other students who do the same, you know?”
Riri-chan said, flicking her skirt.
I worried that it would flip up.
“I think other people probably fix their uniforms or try not to stand out when Kanaori-san is around.”
“Maybe. Kaede is always like that.”
She knows, but the fact that she doesn’t do it herself shows she’s a big shot…
Or maybe it’s pride.
“So why are you asking?”
Riri-chan leaned closer.
“Well, it just seemed like you two didn’t get along…”
And I was thinking about how to get Kanaori-san to reprimand Shindo Minato.
Currently, there’s zero sign of a harem forming around Shindo-kun. (It’s my fault, but still.)
So it’s difficult to approach it from that angle.
Judging from Riri-chan’s story, maybe getting him reprimanded for his attire would be effective.
“…Is that really all?”
“That’s all…”
The distance between me and Riri-chan didn’t shrink, and she gave me a skeptical look.
“I don’t think you’ve ever asked me about another girl before…”
“S-So?”
“Well, Kanaori is pretty, at least on the surface. You’re not… admiring her or anything, are you?”
“No way, definitely not.”
Kanaori-san does have an elegant, ladylike beauty, but being such a strict student council president seems tough.
I admire her, but I could never do it. It seems too restrictive.
“Hmm. Okay, if you say so.”
I finally escaped Riri-chan’s suspicious gaze.
“…But, well. You think Kanaori-san is beautiful too, Riri-chan.”
It showed Riri-chan’s good nature that she could admit that, even though they seem to be at odds.
“H-Hey! That’s not true! I don’t care about someone like her!”
“…Eh, wait, really?”
She just admitted it, and now she’s suddenly backtracking.
She seems a little flustered, too. What’s going on?
“Suzuna is way cuter than her!”
“N-No… we weren’t talking about me. And I can’t compare to Kanaori-san…”
The topic suddenly shifted from Kanaori-san to me.
“That’s not true! I think Suzuna is better!”
She said that with a serious look in her eyes.
…I don’t want to have this conversation in the morning.
I didn’t know how to react.
“O-Okay…”
Riri-chan is troublesome.
◇◇◇
“Yo, Suzuna.”
“…Morning.”
When I sat down at my desk, Shindo-kun greeted me languidly.
I looked at Shindo-kun’s attire.
His shirt was buttoned all the way up, and his tie was neatly tied.
There was nothing wrong with his blazer or slacks either.
…Kanaori-san wouldn’t reprimand him for this.
“? Why are you staring at me?”
“Ah, well… it’s about your clothes—”
I shuddered.
I felt a familiar cold gaze and quickly looked away.
“(What are you talking about?)”
Riri-chan was looking at us, mouthing the words with a smile.
…This is no good.
Casual conversation is one thing, but if I say,
“Why don’t you loosen up your clothes a bit?”
I’ll definitely be scolded later.
She’ll definitely say, “What do you mean, worrying about Shindo’s clothes?”
“What about my clothes?”
“…Nothing.”
I ended the conversation with Shindo-kun.
But now I have to find another way to change Shindo-kun’s appearance.
I only knew one person who could do that.
◇◇◇
During break time.
I went down to the first floor and visited the area near the first-year classrooms.
I came looking for Shindo Kokona-chan.
The atmosphere among the underclassmen was more energetic and youthful than the second-years.
I felt so out of place. I wanted to go home.
…But I have to do this.
“What class is Kokona-chan in…?”
A critical mistake.
I didn’t know Kokona-chan’s class.
And I don’t have the courage to enter each classroom, nor the courage to ask a stranger, even if they are underclassmen.
…I’m stuck.
Standing in the hallway with unfamiliar students passing by, my spirit broke.
“—Amatsuki Suzuna?”
A familiar voice called out from behind me.
I turned around, and there was Kokona-chan, her twintails swaying.
“Ah, Kokona-chan! Thank goodness, I was looking for you!”
“Eh… you were looking for Kokona?”
“Yeah, but I didn’t know where you were, so I was in trouble.”
Speak of the devil, as they say.
“Wh-What? Did you hit your head or something? Why would you come looking for Kokona?”
That’s harsh…
Well, it is unusual for me to do this.
“No, I have a favor to ask.”
“That’s also unusual. What is it?”
“It’s about Shindo-kun.”
“Onii-chan?”
“I want you to… unbutton his shirt.”
“…Huh?”
…Right?
I’m saying something strange, aren’t I?
“N-No, that’s not it. He needs to do that.”
“…I think you’ve lost your mind, Amatsuki Suzuna.”
“N-No, I haven’t! Look, Shindo-kun doesn’t have a girlfriend yet, right? Aren’t you worried, as his little sister?”
“…Well, I don’t see Onii-chan getting a girlfriend anytime soon.”
“So what do you think he’s lacking?”
Kokona-chan put a finger to her chin, thinking.
“…Intelligence?”
That was harsh.
Well, I can’t say she’s wrong.
“D-Don’t you think he also needs… sex appeal?”
“…Well, I don’t see that in Onii-chan. Or rather, it would be scary if I, his little sister, did.”
She’s supposed to be obsessed with her brother, but she’s changed so much.
It’s frightening.
“So, how about… unbuttoning his shirt a bit, or loosening his tie? What do you think?”
“…Well, some boys do dress like that. But you want Onii-chan to do that? It seems like he’d be trying too hard.”
“It’s okay, he’ll definitely find someone nice if he does that.”
That’s how Kanaori-san will notice him, reprimand him, and start their destined encounter.
“I still don’t understand. Why can’t you just ask Onii-chan yourself?”
Kokona-chan seemed annoyed and uncooperative.
I wish I could do it myself, but it wouldn’t be a problem if I could.
“I can’t. You’re the only one I can ask… please.”
I clasped my hands together and pleaded with Kokona-chan.
“…F-Fine. I guess I have no choice.”
Oh, really?
I thought she’d refuse, but she readily agreed.
“Really…?”
“You’ve never asked Kokona for a favor before. It’s fine.”
“Really? Thank goodness, thank you!”
“I-It’s fine. You don’t have to thank me for something like this.”
“No, I would have been in trouble without your help, Kokona-chan. Thank you.”
I was truly grateful.
I sighed in relief.
“W-Well, I’m glad I could help…”
Kokona-chan mumbled something.
“Hmm? What?”
“N-Nothing!”
Kokona-chan raised her voice and looked away.
She rejected the idea at first, then immediately accepted it, and now she’s sulking.
Was she always this complicated?
------------------ 
35 Things Left Unsaid
Lunch break.
“Onii-chan, do you have a minute?”
I asked Kokona-chan to come to our classroom to talk to Shindo-kun.
“What’s up, Kokona?”
“I’m going to teach you some techniques to instantly become popular with the ladies, even though you’re so unremarkable.”
Um, that’s a strange way to start.
I wonder if anyone would readily agree after being talked to like that.
“Please.”
Here we go.
“Kokona realized something. Popular men need sex appeal.”
“I see.”
“So I think you should unbutton your shirt and loosen your tie. Showing a bit of your chest is sexy, right?”
“…Isn’t that only allowed for handsome guys?”
“You can become one, Onii-chan—a handsome-in-spirit kind of guy.”
“Okay, got it.”
Is that really okay?
And what’s with their smooth conversation?
Is this sibling telepathy?
“Now, how’s this?”
Shindo-kun adjusted his clothes as instructed.
“Lame— no, I mean, it’s… not bad.”
“Did you just say ‘lame’?”
“I didn’t.”
“Oh, okay.”
Kokona-chan then took Shindo-kun out into the hallway.
I watched from a distance.
“Good, this is perfect. Now walk down the hallway like this.”
“I’ll show them.”
Shindo-kun strutted confidently down the hallway.
He didn’t realize it, but Kanaori-san was heading towards the student council room, coming in our direction.
If they kept going, they would pass each other.
“…Hey. I did what you said, but is this really okay?”
Kokona-chan came over to where I was watching.
“Yeah, I think it’ll be fine.”
“Why did you choose the timing when Kanaori Reika, the student council president, was coming?”
“You might not believe this, but they’re a good match.”
“Eh…?”
Kokona-chan looked at me skeptically.
Still, I desperately watched their encounter unfold.
They drew closer, only a few steps away from passing each other.
And Kanaori-san’s feet stopped right in front of Shindo-kun.
…Here it comes!
“Shindo-san, wait a moment.”
“Ah, yes?”
“Your shirt is unbuttoned. And your tie is loose.”
“This is… masculine sex appeal…”
“Do you require individual guidance?”
“Oops, my bad! I got too relaxed because it’s lunch break. Thank you, President Kanaori!”
Shindo-kun flashed a dazzling business smile and adjusted his uniform.
“Taking breaks is important, but please maintain a proper appearance.”
“Yes! I’ll be careful!”
—Stroll
Their encounter ended abruptly.
“Eh, wait, that’s it?”
“…Well, yeah, obviously.”
Kokona-chan sighed next to me.
Eh… Kanaori-san is supposed to be more aggressive with Shindo-kun.
So just his clothes aren’t enough to move the story forward…?
“Does it have to be… a harem situation…?”
“Harem?!”
Kokona-chan shrieked next to me.
Well, taken out of context, it does sound like I suddenly made a lewd remark.
“Ah, no, I didn’t mean me. I was talking about Shindo-kun.”
“So it’s not about Amatsuki Suzuna, but about Onii-chan… which still doesn’t make sense!”
In the original story, Shindo-kun is constantly being pursued by the heroines, creating a harem situation.
Unless that becomes the norm, and Kanaori-san reprimands him for it, the Kanaori route won’t be triggered…
So does that mean… it’s a dead end?
“Suzuna, what are you doing in the hallway? It’s time for lunch.”
Riri-chan appeared in the hallway.
“…Hinase Riri.”
“What do you want, Shindo’s little sister?”
The air grew heavy with their animosity…
“Sorry, but Suzuna is eating with me. First-years should obediently go back to their classrooms.”
“What’s that? Pulling the seniority card?”
“…I’m telling you to go back where you belong.”
“Kokona can do what she wants.”
Ah, these two haven’t been getting along since the bento battle.
Why are these relationships the same as in the original story, even though the routes with Shindo-kun have gone off track?
“Now, now, both of you. Let’s get along.”
“It’s because Suzuna ditched me!”
“It’s because you called Kokona out here!”
They both snapped at me simultaneously.
“…I’m sorry.”
Since it was my fault, I apologized.
I’m not confident I can win an argument against these two.
“You three, loitering in the hallway obstructs the flow of traffic.”
The clear, firm voice belonged to Kanaori-san, who was passing by.
…Shindo-kun had to try so hard to get her attention, but she notices me even when I’m not doing anything.
Such is fate.
“S-Sorry! We’ll move right away!”
I was the first to apologize.
Let sleeping dogs lie, as they say.
“…It’s you three again.”
Kanaori-san looked at us and sighed, looking exasperated.
“What do you mean ‘again’?”
Riri-chan retorted.
“It’s only been a day since yesterday. I see your behavior hasn’t improved.”
Now the atmosphere between Kanaori-san and Riri-chan turned hostile.
“Now, now, Riri-chan, Kanaori-san, let’s get along.”
“It’s because Kanaori keeps nitpicking!”
“It’s because Hinase-san lacks decorum!”
…I was scolded by both of them again, simultaneously.
But it can’t be helped that the heroines are at odds with each other when the protagonist is absent.
I want them to make up.
“Riri-chan might be acting all prickly now, but she complimented you this morning, Kanaori-san. She said you were beautiful.”
“Hey, Suzuna…?!”
Riri-chan looked flustered.
“…I find that hard to believe.”
Kanaori-san tilted her head.
“Riri-chan doesn’t lie, so it’s true.”
“Suzuna, that’s a lie.”
“Eh, Riri-chan, you lied…?”
Shocked, I looked at Riri-chan, and she averted her gaze, looking embarrassed.
“…It’s true.”
Yeah, yeah, I know.
“Th-That doesn’t excuse your usual bad behavior! You need to be more responsible!”
“That’s why I don’t like your condescending tone…”
I stopped Riri-chan, who was about to retort.
“Kanaori-san, your words might be harsh, but you’re just saying that because you’re worried about Riri-chan.”
“Ah, Amatsuki-san…?!”
Now it was Kanaori-san’s turn to be flustered.
“W-What do you mean…?”
Riri-chan tilted her head.
“Kanaori-san, you’re just trying to help Riri-chan and make this school a better place, as the student council president. You don’t mean any harm.”
“Even so, there’s a way to say things.”
“Kanaori-san is also a girl our age. And yet, you carry the burden of being the student council president and work for the sake of the students. It must be tough, so it’s understandable that your tone gets harsh sometimes. You worry a lot behind the scenes, don’t you, Kanaori-san?”
“H-Hey, Amatsuki-san?! I never told you that!”
Ah…
That was completely based on my knowledge from the game.
Kanaori-san is always struggling with her own weaknesses and worries, trying to fulfill her duties as student council president.
Knowing that side of her, the relatable Kanaori Reika, makes it easier to tolerate her harsh words.
“So, let’s all get along.”
“…”
“…”
Their animosity seemed to have dissipated.
“To be able to persuade both the gal, Hinase Riri, and the student council president, Kanaori Reika… Amatsuki Suzuna, you’re amazing.”
Kokona-chan next to me seemed impressed.
36 It’s Okay to Be the Same
“So, what was that about earlier?”
In the end, my attempt to manage the Shindo-kun and Kanaori-san route failed.
Shindo-kun disappeared down the hallway, so Riri-chan sat in his seat and we ate lunch together.
“What was what about?”
“You sounded like you understood Kanaori really well.”
…Hmm.
Riri-chan’s tone seemed a bit prickly.
It might be better not to talk too much about it.
“It was just a general observation. Being the student council president is tough, no matter who you are.”
“Is that so? I don’t think Kanaori would react like that to just a general observation.”
“…It’s true.”
Even the strict Kanaori-san will show a cuter side once she opens up to Shindo Minato.
…Well, she doesn’t break out of her student council president mode until much later in the story.
“It’s true. No one would ever think Kanaori has worries.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, she can do anything. No one worries about her.”
“Hmm…”
It might be because I have an objective perspective on this story that my impression of her is different.
“Th-That’s why I’m wondering… what’s with you suddenly understanding her so well, Suzuna?”
She’s smiling, but her eyes aren’t.
She’s definitely not happy.
“…If that’s what it means to understand Kanaori-san, then my understanding of Riri-chan is maxed out.”
“Eh, r-really…?”
“Yeah. Because what I said was just a general observation about how tough her job is. I’m not even friends with her, unlike you, Riri-chan.”
“W-Well, that’s true.”
“…So, what you said doesn’t really resonate with me.”
When I said what I was thinking, Riri-chan started nodding.
“You’re right. Compared to me, you barely know Kanaori.”
“Uh, yeah… well…”
“Okay. That’s fine then.”
Riri-chan seemed convinced and returned to her usual smile.
Her eyes softened, unlike before.
I’m glad she’s no longer upset, but Riri-chan often gets angry when other girls are involved.
She didn’t react like that with Tachibana-san, her friend. I wonder if it’s just rivalry between heroines.
…But she’s still nice to Amatsuki Suzuna (who’s also a heroine)…
Strange.
◇◇◇
“By the way, Suzuna, are you studying for the midterms?”
Riri-chan suddenly asked as we were walking home after school.
“…Not really.”
As April came to an end, midterms were waiting for us in May.
It was a topic I didn’t want to think about, a gloomy topic.
My grades as the real Yukitsuki Mashiro were average.
I think Amatsuki Suzuna is probably a bit smarter.
“Then, want to study with me?”
This is another unusual thing for Riri-chan to say.
“Okay, but were you always so studious, Riri-chan?”
She asked me to teach her during break time the other day. These are unusual actions for someone like Hinase Riri.
“Yeah, I recently started becoming more studious.”
“Why?”
“…Suzuna, would you go to karaoke with me?”
Huh, the topic completely changed.
But I can’t just ignore Riri-chan’s question.
“I don’t usually go.”
Listening to music is fine, but I don’t like the atmosphere where everyone has to sing.
I don’t want to sing, and I hate being treated like I’m ruining the mood if I don’t.
“It’s not the season yet, but what about the beach or the mountains?”
“The beach is too sunny, and there are too many bugs in the mountains.”
I’m a creature of concrete jungles, where the sun is blocked and there are no bugs.
“…I see.”
Riri-chan sighed and muttered.
What does that have to do with studying?
“Is there a rule that you can’t go out if your grades are bad?”
Riri-chan’s dad, who lets her live in a luxury apartment, must be wealthy.
He seems like an elite, so maybe he’s strict about that kind of thing.
“Yes, yes, that’s it.”
“…?”
Her tone sounded like it wasn’t the real reason, but if that’s what she says, then it must be true.
Anyway, Riri-chan seems to be serious about studying.
And Kanaori-san warned me that she would suspect Riri-chan’s bad influence if my grades dropped.
For the sake of route management, it’s best if our test results are good.
“Then, want to come over to my house?”
“…Um…”
Being invited, I recalled Riri-chan’s unguarded appearance from the other day.
I felt like steam was about to come out of my ears.
“I think… somewhere else would be better today.”
“Eh, why? Then where?”
That’s a good question…
I barely know the geography of this world.
I usually only travel between home and school.
“Ah, let’s go to that cafe you took me to before, Riri-chan.”
“Well, that’s fine too.”
Going to Riri-chan’s house again is still too stimulating, so I’d like a little more time.
“Ah, but…”
“Hmm?”
Come to think of it, Kanaori-san told me not to loiter after school.
…But this isn’t playing around, it’s studying for tests, so maybe she’ll forgive me.
“It’s nothing.”
Thinking optimistically, I followed Riri-chan.
◇◇◇
We visited the cafe again.
It’s been a while since that day, but after just one visit, I no longer felt any resistance.
Or rather, it might be thanks to Riri-chan being here.
“What are you ordering?”
Riri-chan handed me the menu.
“I’ll have pancakes and tea.”
“Oh, you’ve already decided? There are other good things here.”
“No, this is fine.”
I don’t have any reason to order anything else.
“Hmm. Suzuna, you really like pancakes and tea, huh?”
“It’s more like… you introduced them to me, Riri-chan.”
“…Hmm?”
“You’re the one who told me about this cafe, and the first thing I ate here was pancakes. And I’ve been into tea lately ever since you made it for me the other day.”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened, and she was speechless.
“S-Stop it, Suzuna. That was a surprise attack!”
“…? I was just telling the truth.”
“That’s why it’s dangerous!”
I don’t understand what’s dangerous about it.
I couldn’t see Riri-chan’s expression because she was hiding behind the menu.
But her voice was high-pitched, so I could tell that I might have said something strange.
“What are you ordering, Riri-chan?”
“Oh, I’ll have the same.”
“Eh, but you said there were other good things here?”
“No, I’ll have the same as Suzuna, on purpose.”
“Okay, but why?”
I don’t understand the reason.
“…As a memento.”
Even after asking, I still didn’t understand.
------------------ 
37 Something Intangible
“Suzuna, I can’t do this anymore…”
After about an hour of studying at the cafe, Riri-chan slumped onto the table, defeated.
I could practically see smoke coming out of her head.
“But you were the one who said you wanted to study…”
“I didn’t think I’d have to concentrate for this long.”
“But it’s only been about an hour.”
“Even classes aren’t this long.”
That might be true, but…
“You’re not good at studying, are you?”
Not that I’m good at it either.
“I don’t like it. I can’t… keep reading.”
“Then should we switch to math?”
“That doesn’t mean numbers are okay.”
“Oh, I see…”
Duly noted.
“Let’s take a break, a break.”
Riri-chan rested her chin on the table and tapped my textbook with both hands.
That gesture was childish and somehow cute.
“Well, you’re right. Studying too much is tiring.”
I might have been too tense, thinking I had to teach Riri-chan.
I realized I had been studying quite seriously, and I was surprisingly tired.
I let out a breath and leaned back against the sofa.
“Then, next is love talk.”
“…Excuse me?”
Riri-chan was grinning.
She looked really excited.
“Love talk, it’s normal to talk about love.”
“…I-I don’t know what ‘normal’ is.”
Romance is something that exists in a faraway world, as far as I’m concerned.
It’s not a topic I’d talk about personally.
“No, no, what are you saying? You used to like Shindo, right? Don’t pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about.”
“…That’s true, but…”
It’s true, but it’s also not true.
That was Amatsuki Suzuna, not me, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
But I can’t say that, so I just nodded silently, feeling frustrated.
“So, you don’t have anyone you like now?”
I couldn’t look Riri-chan in the eye, so I averted my gaze.
“O-Of course not!”
This complicated situation is because I can’t bring myself to like Shindo Minato, the protagonist.
“Really? You don’t have to be embarrassed.”
No, it would be embarrassing, no matter how you look at it.
“What about you, Riri-chan? Since you brought it up, do you have someone you like?”
I desperately tried to deflect the question back to Riri-chan.
I don’t think I can escape this topic, but being bombarded with questions is also tough.
“Yeah, I have someone I like.”
Riri-chan said casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
She has someone she likes.
“Eh…?”
No, that’s strange.
Riri-chan isn’t interested in Shindo Minato, the protagonist, right now.
The character Hinase Riri is designed to like Shindo Minato.
Is it even possible for her to like someone else?
“S-Seriously…?”
“Seriously.”
“Wh-Who…?”
Riri-chan chuckled and sipped her tea, teasing me.
She’s being very coy.
“Do you want to know?”
“I do.”
Who is the person who captured Hinase Riri’s heart?
I’m curious, for various reasons.
“It’s a secret.”
“Eh…”
I was completely shut down.
Isn’t this supposed to be the part where she tells me?
“Because you won’t tell me, Suzuna. It’s not fair if I’m the only one who shares.”
“…Well, I guess that’s true.”
It’s true that it would be presumptuous of me to expect her to just tell me.
“Fufu, if you want to know, you have to confess too, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan wouldn’t tell me, no matter how much I asked.
◇◇◇
“Well, we ended up just chatting, didn’t we?”
Leaving the cafe, Riri-chan stretched widely.
It was already completely dark outside.
We ended up spending the last two hours just chatting about random things.
It’s incredibly inefficient that we spent far more time talking than studying.
“I was thinking we should study…”
This counts as loitering; Kanaori-san will be angry.
“Well, it’s fine. I had fun spending time with you, Suzuna.”
“…Yeah, that’s true.”
Time really does fly when I’m with Riri-chan.
I thought I was bad at talking to people, but it was a discovery that I could talk for this long.
“Ehehe.”
Riri-chan grinned and leaned against me.
“Riri-chan?”
“Let’s take a picture.”
“…A picture?”
“Why are you speaking English?”
I’m not good with pictures, so I wanted to escape.
It’s that thing, right? Taking selfies at flattering angles.
“It’s fine since we’re friends, right?”
Riri-chan’s eyes sparkled.
For some reason, she wants to take a picture with me.
But I don’t want to…
“Um, well, it’s already dark outside. I don’t think the picture will turn out well.”
“Ah, then let’s take it by the store’s sign. It’s lit up, and there are streetlights too.”
I guess it can’t be helped…
Unable to think of another excuse, I let myself be dragged along.
“Okay, say cheese!”
“Ah, a-a-a…”
What expression should I make? And where should I look? Wait, the pose is also important, isn’t it? Should I keep my mouth closed? But that might make me look grumpy. But if I open it, I might look stupid…
Ah, I don’t know the right answer!
—Click
The camera shutter clicked.
“Suzuna, your expression is so stiff.”
Riri-chan giggled, looking at the picture.
I looked at the phone. Riri-chan was making a cute peace sign near her face, while I was looking off into the distance with my mouth half-open.
“I… request deletion…”
“Eh, it’s fine. It’s cute in its own way.”
“H-How is this…?”
“Then let’s take another one.”
This… ordeal… again…?
I can only imagine a future filled with more of these failed pictures.
“It’s fine, look at the phone screen properly. You only messed up because you were acting so strangely.”
I did as Riri-chan said.
The camera shutter clicked again.
“See? This one is good, right?”
“…I guess.”
My expression was still stiff, but it was a picture of Amatsuki Suzuna that I could at least bear to look at.
Well, compared to Riri-chan next to me, it’s like the difference between the moon and a mud ball.
“I’ll send it to you later.”
I hesitated for a moment.
Should I really keep such an unflattering picture of myself on my phone?
I briefly considered what kind of masochistic act this was, but…
“Okay, please.”
But since Riri-chan is next to me, I’ll take it.
“Okay. Then I guess we’ll call it a day. See you later, Suzuna.”
“Yeah. Bye-bye, Riri-chan.”
We waved goodbye.
I walked home along the streetlit road.
It was a little chilly at night.
Perhaps because of the silence, I felt a little lonely, separated from Riri-chan’s lively presence.
“I have someone I like.”
Riri-chan’s words came to mind.
I don’t know who it is, but Riri-chan is apparently in love.
Thinking about it, I felt a strange sensation in my chest.
An uncomfortable feeling, a mix of unease and a slight pang.
I don’t know what it is.
Being alone like this, that feeling only intensified.
But I don’t know what it is, so I can’t do anything about it.
“…Strange.”
My words, spoken to no one, disappeared into the night air.
But the intangible something in my chest wouldn’t disappear.
38 Even Volleyballs Hurt When Hit
P.E. class.
It’s the class I hate the most.
“Sigh…”
Heaving a sigh filled with gloom, I somehow made it to the changing room.
Apparently, we’re having volleyball class in the gym today.
I hesitantly changed into my gym clothes.
“…”
Naturally, the other girls were also changing.
They were, of course, in their underwear, and I had a thought.
(Looking at my classmates’ underwear… doesn’t do anything for me, huh?)
I panicked when I saw Riri-chan’s underwear at her house, but I don’t feel anything towards the other girls.
I might think, “She has a nice figure,” or “She has more belly fat than I expected,” but…
That’s about it.
I only have indifferent observations.
But I think that’s normal.
Then why did my heart race so much when I saw Riri-chan’s?
“Suzuna?”
“Wh-What?!”
Riri-chan, in her gym clothes, appeared, bouncing lightly.
“I was wondering why you were looking around so much.”
“I-I wasn’t looking!”
I panicked inwardly, as if Riri-chan had seen right through me.
“Hmm, suspicious. Suzuna, are you interested in girls?”
“Why would you think that?”
“Who knows? Maybe I should take a look too~”
Riri-chan stared intently at me.
“Wh-What?”
“You really are fair-skinned and slender, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s gaze moved up and down my body.
Since I was in the middle of changing, I was also in my underwear.
“H-Hey, where are you looking…?”
“Hmm? Where? …Everywhere?”
I don’t understand how she can say that so boldly with a grin.
“Pervert.”
“You were doing the same thing, Suzuna.”
That’s different. I was just looking around, taking in the scenery. I wasn’t focusing on anyone in particular like Riri-chan.
And commenting on someone’s body is the act of a pervert.
“I wasn’t doing tha—”
I was about to say “that,” but I stopped.
I did something similar at Riri-chan’s house.
Even though it was unavoidable, I kept staring.
So does that make me a pervert too?
“You weren’t doing… what?”
“I don’t know.”
Unable to come up with a good excuse, I quickly finished changing into my gym clothes.
◇◇◇
We were playing volleyball in P.E.
The teams were randomly assigned, but we could also form groups with people we liked.
I joined a group that needed an extra person.
They’re nice people for including me, but I felt awkward since I don’t usually interact with them.
Riri-chan, on the other hand, was with Tachibana-san and her usual group of friends.
Riri-chan kept trying to include me, but I asked her not to.
I can’t join their group.
It’s not just because of my social anxiety.
—Tweet
The teacher’s whistle signaled the start of the game.
My team served first, and the other team returned it.
We received the ball, and the toss went up.
…To me.
“Amatsuki-san, here!”
The girl who tossed the ball even called out to me politely.
Thank you.
But I don’t need that.
“Suzuna, go for it!!”
I heard Riri-chan’s voice.
She’s probably watching from the sidelines.
But I don’t have time to check.
Because the ball is falling towards me.
I stared at the ball and jumped, timing my jump.
All I have to do is match the highest point of my jump with the ball’s trajectory and swing my arm.
It’s simple.
“Hiya!”
—Whoosh
My arm sliced through the air.
Strange.
I didn’t hear the sound of the ball being hit.
I looked up again.
The ball was still far above my head.
Apparently, I jumped and swung too early.
“Ouch!”
The ball landed on my head.
A volleyball is quite hard, so it made a decent impact.
The ball rolled at my feet.
“…”
Everyone’s silent.
They’re speechless after witnessing my painful miss.
This is the worst.
“Suzuna! You jumped too early! The ball was still way up there!”
Riri-chan’s cheering was painful to hear.
Stop it, please stop.
Don’t add insult to injury.
I’m just not good at sports.
And I’m especially bad at ball games, which require a sense of timing and practice.
Why do I, a human, have to match the timing of a ball made by humans?
The volleyball should be the one adjusting to me.
“D-Don’t worry, Amatsuki-san. Let’s do our best next time!”
“Yeah… I’m hoping there won’t be a next time.”
“A-Ahaha…”
Even the girl who invited me gave a strained laugh.
I continued to miss the ball every time it came towards me.
Someone kill me.
◇◇◇
Naturally, my team lost.
I don’t care about winning or losing, but if I’m the reason for the loss, I can’t help but feel guilty.
I huddled in a corner, trying to avoid everyone’s gaze.
I wish I could just disappear.
“Suzuna, you were spiking at the air. You’re supposed to hit the volleyball.”
But Riri-chan, ignoring my shame, spoke to me without hesitation.
“I’m trying to hit it, but I can’t.”
“It’s amazing, though. You missed every single one.”
Riri-chan, please don’t rub it in.
I know.
“Now you understand. I didn’t want to burden you with my lack of skill, Riri-chan.”
“Ahh, is that it? You don’t have to worry about it.”
No, I do worry about it.
I don’t want to burden anyone, especially those close to me.
I didn’t even want to be seen playing.
“Riri, it’s our turn.”
Tachibana-san called out to Riri-chan.
“Okay, I’m coming. …Suzuna, watch my game!”
“Yeah, good luck.”
Riri-chan grinned, swung her arms, and entered the court.
…Come to think of it, I wonder how athletic Riri-chan is.
It wasn’t described in detail in the original story.
Well, Riri-chan is in the going-home club and a gal.
So she’s probably not good at sports.
She’s probably leagues better than me, but I’d be happy if we were in the same category.
—Tweet
The whistle blew, signaling the start of the game.
Riri-chan was serving.
“Here I go~”
She tossed the ball and jumped.
Swinging her arm as if to smash it, the ball transformed from a sphere into a line.
—Whack
The next moment, the ball bounced powerfully off the floor.
“…Did you see Hinase Riri-san’s serve just now?”
“I did, I did! And the receiver was Endo-san from the volleyball club! She’s been playing since her first year!”
I also overheard the whispers of my classmates.
…Seriously?
She’s a gal, and she’s good at sports?
“Here, Kaede.”
The game became one-sided.
This time, Riri-chan tossed the ball to Tachibana-san.
“Riri, that was a sloppy toss.”
Even though Tachibana-san complained about the oddly high and off-center toss, she adjusted well and scored a point.
Apparently, Tachibana-san is also good at sports.
Popular people are good at socializing and sports. How nice.
Please be good at just one of them.
I’m not good at either. Sigh…
“But we got the point.”
“Thanks to me.”
They high-fived each other, laughing.
…Seeing that, I felt a pang in my chest.
I wonder why.
Their friendly, understanding atmosphere made me feel… uncomfortable.
I never felt anything before, no matter how close Tachibana-san and Riri-chan were.
But now, it bothered me a lot.
The game ended quickly.
“Suzuna, did you see? I did my best!”
Riri-chan came back to me.
But right now, I wasn’t sure I could talk to her properly.
“I didn’t see.”
“Eh, really? Even though I was so amazing?”
“I don’t care.”
“Aww, that’s too bad. Make sure you watch next time!”
“…Maybe.”
I don’t know why.
But I wasn’t sure I could bear to watch Riri-chan getting along with other girls.
------------------ 
39 Waiting Is Also Important
In the morning, I arrived at school much earlier than usual.
I went to the empty gymnasium.
Seiran Academy is a preparatory school and doesn’t focus heavily on club activities.
Therefore, the gym is empty in the morning.
I had just sent Riri-chan a message saying, “I’m leaving early this morning, so I can’t go with you.”
If I told her in advance, she might say, “Then I’ll go with you.”
Still half-asleep, I held a volleyball in one hand.
Yes, I came for morning practice.
“An introvert in the gym this early in the morning… so out of character.”
I couldn’t help but scoff at myself.
But what’s driving me to do this?
The scene from yesterday wouldn’t leave my mind.
The image of Riri-chan and Tachibana-san playing volleyball together so harmoniously kept flashing through my mind.
It’s probably because I feel embarrassed that I’m friends with Riri-chan, who’s so good at volleyball, while I’m so terrible at it.
So I felt like I couldn’t allow myself to remain bad at volleyball.
I’m sure this hazy, unsettled feeling feeling will disappear if I get better.
But I won’t improve if I don’t practice.
And I don’t want to be seen failing repeatedly.
The answer I came up with was morning practice.
—Thump, thump
I bounced the volleyball on the floor, and it returned to my hand.
Yeah, I feel like I’m getting a better feel for the ball than yesterday.
I tossed the ball into the air and swung my arm.
—Whoosh… Thump, thump…
The sound of my miss and the ball rolling across the floor echoed through the morning gymnasium.
“…Hmm. Am I swinging too early?”
Then maybe I should swing more slowly.
I tossed the ball again.
—Thump, thump… Whoosh…
This time, the ball hit the floor first, and then the sound of my swing followed.
“Too late this time…”
My timing is off.
Is a ball really this disobedient?
It looks round and harmless, but it’s not cute at all.
“Um… Amatsuki-san, what are you doing so early in the morning?”
A clear, dignified voice cut through the tense morning air.
I turned around, and Kanaori-san was looking at me with a puzzled expression.
I didn’t expect an audience.
“As you can see, I’m practicing volleyball.”
“I apologize. The movements you were making were quite different from the volleyball I know…”
It was hard to tell if she was being sarcastic or if she was genuinely confused.
“…Was it… that strange?”
“It was… peculiar.”
“…I see.”
I felt my spirits sink.
I knew I was bad, but it hurts to be told that directly.
And more than anything, there’s no point in practicing early in the morning if someone sees me.
“What are you doing here so early, Kanaori-san?”
“I always arrive at school around this time. I heard noises coming from the usually empty gymnasium, so I came to check out of concern.”
…As expected of the student council president.
She’s so exemplary that I’m speechless.
“I see. Then there’s no problem. I’m just practicing volleyball, as you can see.”
I wanted her to leave if she had no business here.
I don’t want her to see my peculiar movements.
“You’re practicing volleyball… by yourself?”
“Yes.”
“Wouldn’t it be better to practice with someone?”
…Doesn’t she understand that I’m alone because I don’t want to practice with anyone?
“It’s fine, I’m practicing alone.”
“Volleyball is a team sport, so I think practicing alone is inefficient.”
Kanaori-san wouldn’t leave.
What does she want?
Do I have to be more explicit?
“I’m bad at it, so I don’t want to be seen. That’s why I’m practicing alone. I’ll play with everyone after I get better.”
She’ll understand if I say this.
It’s embarrassing to say, but I’ve just been through a much more embarrassing situation, so my sense of shame is numb.
“I see. That’s why.”
Even though she sounded like she understood, Kanaori-san still showed no signs of leaving.
Instead, she picked up the volleyball that was at my feet.
“Then you’re mistaken about what you should be ashamed of.”
“Eh?”
“You’re trying to improve yourself, and that attitude is commendable. You should be more confident.”
Kanaori-san stood opposite me and got into position to hit the ball.
“I’ll join you in your practice.”
“Eh, no, that’s too much trouble.”
“If you’re worried about being embarrassed, I’ve already seen you. There shouldn’t be a problem.”
“…Well, that’s true, but…”
Even so, I’m hesitant to take up the busy student council president’s time.
“Here we go.”
—Toss
But Kanaori-san tossed the ball without hesitation.
The ball arced towards me.
“Eh, ah, th— Hiya!”
—Whoosh… Roll, roll…
The same thing happened again.
“Amatsuki-san, may I offer some advice?”
“…Please.”
“Why are you trying to spike every ball?”
“…Hmm?”
What is she talking about?
“Well, I thought it might be because you’re trying to hit every ball with a spiking motion, which is making it difficult.”
“Kanaori-san, with all due respect, it’s not volleyball if I don’t hit the ball back.”
“…No, if you receive the ball, you can return it if you wait for the right timing.”
Kanaori-san extended her arms and clasped her hands together.
Since she said “Go ahead,” I tossed the ball.
Kanaori-san positioned her hands to receive the ball as it fell.
—Thud
The ball arced beautifully and returned to me.
I see, this is what they call a rally!
I swung my arm with all my might.
“Hiya!”
—Whoosh… Roll, roll…
“…Amatsuki-san.”
“…Yes?”
“Were you listening to me?”
“I was.”
“Then why are you trying to spike again?”
“…A habit?”
“You’re not that good yet!”
This is painful, so painful.
Even unskilled people have habits!
“Well, I understand. I need to learn how to receive.”
“O-Okay…”
The start of class was approaching.
I could hear people in the school building.
It’s about time to stop.
“Thank you very much. You’re good at volleyball too, Kanaori-san.”
“I only received the ball…”
Kanaori-san was being modest.
That also showed her magnanimity.
“Compared to me, you’re a god.”
“…No, but everyone starts out unskilled. You worry too much, Amatsuki-san.”
People say that, but people with natural talent are good from the start.
“So you were also bad at it at first, Kanaori-san?”
“Yes, I’m not very athletic. I was just like you at first, Amatsuki-san. I just practiced.”
“Hmm…”
Even Kanaori-san experienced that.
“So you shouldn’t worry too much about what others think and be afraid to show your weaknesses. If you do that, someone will teach you how to improve, like today.”
…I see.
Such insightful and mature advice, unexpected from someone my age.
But I felt a slight dissonance in her words.
“Then, Kanaori-san, maybe you should also… relax a little?”
“…Eh?”
“Well, you have this image of being talented, beautiful, and perfect. But you’re actually not good at some things, like sports, right?”
“Well, yeah…”
“But aren’t you trying too hard to live up to the ideal image of a student council president?”
“…I can’t say that’s not true.”
“Then you’re being contradictory. Isn’t that the same as what you just told me?”
“You shouldn’t worry too much about what others think and be afraid to show your weaknesses. If you do that, someone will teach you how to improve, like today.”
Those words should also apply to Kanaori-san’s approach as student council president.
“But I felt that everyone expected that ideal image of a student council president from me.”
“Ah… that’s such a boomerang statement. No one cares that much.”
“…Is that so?”
“That’s what I think.”
“…I see.”
“That’s very insightful.”
Kanaori-san nodded repeatedly.
I just repeated her own words back to her, though.
40 A Game of Catch with the Heart
“Amatsuki-san, why did you decide to practice alone?”
Even after leaving the gymnasium, Kanaori-san continued to talk to me.
Since we’re both second-years, our routes home are mostly the same, so she apparently intends to walk with me to the classroom.
“Well, I thought it would be bad if I remained unskilled…”
“Why did you think it would be bad to remain unskilled? There must have been a trigger.”
She’s being quite inquisitive.
I don’t think it’s that big of a deal.
“My friend was good at it, so I thought… I’d be left behind if I didn’t improve… I guess.”
“I see. You wanted to be on the same level as your friend.”
“Well, yeah… I guess.”
Even as I said that, something didn’t feel right.
I’m not that competitive. I’m more of a pacifist.
So I don’t get along with sports, which are based on competition.
It’s strange that even I felt motivated to practice…
“A friend who motivates you to improve is a rare find. You have a good relationship.”
Ah, I wonder about that…
In my case, I only receive stimulation from Riri-chan; I don’t think I’m giving anything back.
So in that sense, maybe it’s not a good relationship.
“Well then, I’ll excuse myself.”
“Ah, okay.”
We had just reached the second-year classrooms, so I parted ways with Kanaori-san there.
◇◇◇
“Eh…”
When I entered the classroom, someone was already in my seat.
A beautiful girl with long legs crossed, resting her chin on her hand while looking out the window.
It was Riri-chan.
Noticing me, Riri-chan immediately turned around.
Her furrowed brow told me she had something to say.
“Suzuna, good morning.”
“M-Morning…”
Even her greeting felt different from usual.
“So, what was that about today? Why did you leave me?”
I sent her a message this morning saying, “I’m going to school early,” but apparently, she wants to know more.
“Eh, was something wrong…?”
“Not wrong, but… it was too sudden, and you didn’t say what you were doing, and you weren’t in the classroom when I got to school. It was a bit… confusing.”
No, it was wrong…
Riri-chan was swinging her crossed leg.
Her displeased mood was evident in her attitude.
“Well, I had something to do at school early this morning…”
“…Hmm. Well, that’s fine, but… you’ll tell me what it was, right?”
She’s… that bothered by it…?
Well… Kanaori-san also told me not to worry so much about what others think, so maybe I should be honest.
“I was… practicing volleyball. I can’t use the gym freely except in the morning.”
“Eh, volleyball practice? Suzuna, you liked volleyball that much?”
“No, I actually hate it…”
“I know. Then why?”
Because I felt uneasy after seeing Riri-chan and Tachibana-san playing volleyball so well together?
Or because I’m disgusted with myself for being so unskilled that I can’t join them?
Both seem true, and yet not quite true.
“…I wonder why.”
“You don’t even know yourself?”
It’s true that waking up early and doing something I’m not used to requires considerable effort.
What’s the driving force behind this uncharacteristic burst of energy?
I’m sure it has something to do with Riri-chan.
—Clatter
The teacher entered the classroom.
Noticing the teacher, Riri-chan stood up.
“Well, whatever. Don’t do that again.”
“Ah, okay…”
I don’t understand why I shouldn’t do it again, but it seems like she won’t budge unless it’s absolutely necessary.
It’s not something I’m passionate enough about to argue over, so I just nodded obediently.
Riri-chan left, and I sat down in my seat.
(It’s warm…)
I must have been sitting there for a while.
The chair felt slightly warm, like someone had been sitting there.
Thinking that it was Riri-chan’s body heat made me feel like I was doing something wrong.
But then I thought, isn’t it strange that I’m being affected by something like this? And I became confused.
◇◇◇
After school.
Riri-chan cheered up after that.
But since I can’t do morning practice anymore, it’s impossible to improve in secret.
Well… I’m so bad at it anyway, so maybe it’s fine as it is.
Maybe accepting my limitations is part of growing up?
I was thinking the complete opposite of what I thought this morning.
“Amatsuki-san, are you free now?”
“…Huh?”
An unexpected voice called out to me.
It was Kanaori-san.
Why is she talking to me?
“It’s not ‘huh.’ It’s volleyball practice time.”
“B-But it’s after school…”
Don’t you have club activities?
“You’re in luck. The volleyball club has their spring tournament coming up, so they’re only having a meeting today. Half the court is free.”
“Wh-What?”
I wasn’t sure if this was good timing or bad timing.
Or rather, that’s not even the main issue.
“Kanaori-san, are you going to teach me again?”
“Yes, I couldn’t just leave you like that. I’ll teach you the basics.”
Th-Thank you… but I’m not happy about it.
Why are the heroines so concerned about me instead of Shindo Minato?
I wish they’d direct their attention towards the protagonist a little more.
“Hey, Kanaori, what are you doing with Suzuna?”
Riri-chan’s voice was colder than ice.
It was a tone I’d never heard her use with me. Even when she’s angry, she’s usually more gentle.
“Oh, Hinase-san. I was just suggesting volleyball practice.”
“…Huh? Why are you doing that?”
“It was just a coincidence. I saw Amatsuki-san practicing alone this morning, so I offered her some advice.”
Hearing that, Riri-chan’s head turned slowly, like a rusty machine.
Her sharp gaze pierced me.
“Suu-zuu-na? What’s that? I wasn’t told anything about this.”
“I told you…”
“I wasn’t told you were practicing with her.”
Riri-chan pointed at Kanaori-san.
…It’s true that I might not have mentioned practicing with Kanaori-san.
But that’s only because Riri-chan was giving off such a scary vibe that I didn’t have the chance to explain everything…
And is it really such a big deal that I practiced with Kanaori-san…?
“Hinase-san, don’t point at people. It’s rude.”
“I’m the one who’s offended! Why were you practicing with Suzuna?”
“…? As I said, it was a coincidence. If you have a problem with that, shouldn’t you be blaming yourself for sleeping in this morning?”
“I would have woken up if Suzuna had told me!”
“You can’t do anything unless you’re told? That’s something a child would say. Ah, my apologies. You’re not even a child, considering you can’t even wear your uniform properly.”
“Why you…!!”
“Did I say something wrong?”
Why are they suddenly insulting each other…?
This is scary…
“Come on, Amatsuki-san, let’s go. Let’s ignore this delinquent.”
“Wait a minute! I’m going too!”
“Eh…”
I, the person involved, felt the most left out.
------------------ 
41 A Clash of Wills
The gymnasium.
Half the court was being used by the girls’ basketball club, and the other half was empty.
And there I was, completely out of place.
“Alright, Amatsuki-san. Let’s begin.”
Kanaori-san called out to me clearly.
“Hey, wait a minute. Why are you giving instructions?”
Riri-chan’s tone was critical.
While a large group was practicing on the other side of the court, we were just three people.
We were wearing our gym clothes, but I still felt bad for taking up space when we weren’t even in a sports club.
“Um… I was thinking… even if half the court is free, shouldn’t other clubs be using it?”
Even if not, wouldn’t the basketball club want to use the full court?
“Don’t worry. I’ve already spoken to the teacher in charge.”
As expected of the student council president. She’s so efficient.
“Y-You got permission?”
“Yes. I explained that there was a student eager to improve her volleyball skills, and they readily agreed.”
There’s no need to phrase it like that…
Now I feel like the basketball club’s teacher is glancing at us.
They’re probably thinking, “That klutz is practicing?”
I-I’m starting to have second thoughts…
“Isn’t that… abuse of power…?”
“The student council doesn’t have that kind of power. And I told you I spoke to the teacher. Please listen carefully.”
The atmosphere between Riri-chan and Kanaori-san was still hostile.
Can we really practice volleyball together when they’re being so prickly?
“First, Amatsuki-san, let’s start with receiving practice. Please get into the position I showed you this morning.”
“O-Okay!”
I got into the position she taught me.
Kanaori-san stood opposite me, holding a volleyball.
The net was also set up, and everything was ready for a game.
“I’ll serve, so please adjust to the falling ball, Amatsuki-san. You don’t need to swing your arm.”
“O-Okay!”
Kanaori-san served.
—Toss
The ball arced slowly towards me.
The ball, aimed at my position, seemed like it would fall right into my hands even if I didn’t move.
Kanaori-san was being very considerate.
“…Huh?”
Suddenly, a figure appeared before me, blocking my view.
Her back arched as she jumped high, her ponytail swaying.
“That’s too easy!”
With a beautiful form, she swung her arm fluidly.
—Whoosh
The ball flew straight over the net.
A perfect spike landed right at Kanaori-san’s feet.
“Hmph… I thought the ball had stopped, it was so slow.”
Riri-chan landed gracefully on the court, a confident smile on her face.
Of course, I didn’t do anything.
“Hey, what are you doing?! Don’t interrupt Amatsuki-san’s practice!”
“That’s why I said, stop ignoring me! I’ll practice with her instead!”
Riri-chan strode boldly onto Kanaori-san’s side of the court and picked up the ball.
“Here, Suzuna. You don’t have to return her serves. I’ll serve to you.”
“Ah, o-okay…”
Well, it doesn’t matter if Riri-chan serves.
Or rather, I couldn’t refuse in this atmosphere, so I just nodded.
“Here, Suzuna. Here I go.”
—Toss
A very gentle serve came towards me.
It was completely catered to my skill level, probably.
Grateful for Riri-chan’s kindness, I braced myself, determined to do it right this time.
“…Eh, w-what?”
But again, a figure appeared before me, blocking my view.
Her back arched as she jumped high, her long golden hair swaying.
“That’s too easy!”
With a beautiful form, she swung her arm fluidly.
—Whoosh
The ball flew straight over the net.
A perfect spike landed right at Riri-chan’s feet.
“Hmph… That serve was so weak, I thought it had stopped.”
Kanaori-san landed gracefully on the court, a confident smile on her face.
Of course, I didn’t do anything.
…W-Wait a minute.
This is the exact same scenario as before, just with Riri-chan and Kanaori-san switched!
“Hey, what are you doing?! Don’t interrupt my practice with Suzuna!”
“This was originally practice between Amatsuki-san and me. You, an outsider, should just watch quietly.”
“O-Outsider…? Who are you talking to?”
“I’m talking to you, Hinase Riri. Is that not clear?”
Their gazes clashed.
They were both ready to fight…
“I’m obviously the better choice. Suzuna and I are friends, so it’s definitely easier for me to teach her.”
“That’s not a valid reason. If that’s the case, why didn’t Amatsuki-san invite you to practice this morning?”
Kanaori-san said something that made even me flinch.
“W-Well…”
“The answer is simple. Amatsuki-san decided she didn’t need to learn from you.”
“Huh…? What’s that? That’s just your imagination!”
“At the very least, Amatsuki-san agreed to practice with me. So it’s an undeniable fact that she chose me over you.”
Riri-chan gritted her teeth.
“Suzuna! Are you really choosing Kanaori over me?!”
The spear of her anger turned towards me.
“N-No, I’m happy with anyone who’s willing to teach me…”
I’m not in a position to choose, and I haven’t even considered who’s more suitable.
“See? It’s all your imagination!”
“But being ‘friends’ isn’t a valid reason to prioritize you.”
“Fine, fine, I get it. Then it’s obviously better for someone who’s good at volleyball to teach her.”
“I agree. Then I have no objections.”
Kanaori-san walked onto the opposite court.
She reached for the ball that was at Riri-chan’s feet… and their hands overlapped.
“Hey, Kanaori, what are you doing?”
“Hinase-san, please move your hand.”
“Didn’t you hear me? I said the better player should teach Suzuna.”
“Yes, of course. And haven’t we just established that I’m the better player?”
…These two… they don’t know how to compromise.
“Huh? I’m obviously better. Didn’t you see my spike earlier? I should be the one teaching her.”
“You seem to have missed my spike. I see, with such poor dynamic vision, your skills are obvious. I should be the one teaching her.”
They both grabbed the volleyball and refused to let go.
“You stubborn idiot, you clearly don’t understand unless I show you directly.”
“I agree. Let’s settle this.”
They both went to opposite sides of the court and faced each other.
I watched from the corner of the gymnasium.
“Let’s see if you can return this serve!”
—Whoosh
Riri-chan served with a full-powered spike.
“You call that a serve? You’re quite the comedian.”
But Kanaori-san received it effortlessly.
She tossed the ball to herself and—
—Whoosh
“How about this? Will you surrender now?!”
She returned a lightning-fast spike.
“I can see that coming from a mile away…!”
But Riri-chan received it too.
She tossed the ball to herself and—
—Whoosh
Returned another spike.
“Impressive…! But I can handle this!”
“Are you… receiving it again?!”
Wait… what about my practice?
◇◇◇
The two of them continued their battle.
I watched for a while, and the ball still hadn’t touched the floor.
The sounds of spikes, receives, and tosses echoed continuously through the gymnasium.
“Hey… wasn’t the volleyball club off today?”
“No, those two aren’t in the volleyball club.”
“No way? They’re way better than the volleyball club…”
“Neither of them are in any club… One is the student council president, and the other is in the going-home club.”
“…Talent is cruel. I’m thinking of quitting club activities.”
Their skill was so impressive that it was discouraging to those who were actually trying to improve in their clubs.
And am I supposed to play after this?
Am I supposed to show my pathetic volleyball skills after witnessing such a high-level battle?
…H-Help me.
42 Wanting to Know More
“…You’re… too persistent.”
“…You’re the one who’s being stubborn.”
In the end, neither of them yielded an inch, and the match remained undecided.
Before me were two girls, knees trembling like newborn fawns, their pride refusing to let them fall.
I picked up the ball that had rolled over to me.
“Hey, shouldn’t you have just asked Suzuna which of us she preferred from the beginning?”
Riri-chan, looking at me, said something strange.
“You’re right. It would have been best to respect her wishes.”
Kanaori-san agreed and looked at me as well.
“Eh…”
After such an intense match, it’s up to me in the end?
I wanted to ask what the point of their battle was, but I couldn’t say anything insensitive since they had worked so hard for my sake.
“…How about you two take turns?”
“Seriously?”
“Is that so?”
It was a suggestion that seemed to render their battle meaningless, but I couldn’t possibly judge which of them was better.
It was mortifying to show my pathetic volleyball skills after Riri-chan and Kanaori-san’s match.
But I endured.
After I managed to return the ball somewhat consistently, the practice ended.
Thanks to their cooperation.
“Ah, I’m tired.”
Riri-chan sat down on the court and sighed.
“Amatsuki-san has improved, and we’ve achieved our goal, so I’m relieved. I’ll excuse myself now.”
Kanaori-san turned to leave the gymnasium.
“Are you going home?”
“No, I still have work to do, so I’ll return to the student council room.”
She still has work to do after all that exercise…?
I’m in awe of her energy.
“D-Do your best.”
Kanaori-san looked momentarily surprised, then—
“Yes, thank you.”
—She smiled shyly and left.
“Hey, Suzuuu-na, whaaat was that?”
“Eh, ah, Riri-chan…?”
Riri-chan suddenly put her arm around my shoulders from behind.
I was surprised by her closeness.
“I’ve never been told ‘do your best’ by Suzuna.”
“Eh? I-Is that so…?”
“Nope. You told Kanaori to ‘do her best,’ but not me? I can’t believe it.”
Riri-chan pouted.
She seemed quite dissatisfied.
“I-It was just a coincidence! I cheer for you too, Riri-chan.”
“Really? But Kanaori looked happy, and I’m not really feeling good about it.”
Riri-chan was acting like a spoiled child.
She’s been busy today, getting angry and throwing tantrums.
“It’s true. More importantly, practice is over, so let’s change and go home.”
I couldn’t bear the stares of so many people anymore.
I wanted to escape the gymnasium quickly.
“Well, I guess it can’t be helped. Suzuna…”
For some reason, Riri-chan’s face lit up at those words.
I don’t understand, but I’m glad she’s no longer upset.
◇◇◇
“It’s already dark outside.”
Since we’re both in the going-home club, we don’t usually stay at school this late.
So it felt new to walk home together as the sun set.
“It really is. It’s usually cold, but it feels just right after exercising.”
The cold night air seemed pleasant to Riri-chan’s flushed body.
She fanned the front of her shirt, which revealed more skin than usual, and I felt my heart skip a beat.
I quickly looked away.
“Y-Yeah. It’s hot, isn’t it?”
“Yeah. But I never thought I’d be exercising with you like this, Suzuna.”
“…That’s true.”
“So why did you suddenly decide to play volleyball?”
Riri-chan asked the same question she asked this morning.
“…I told you, I don’t really know myself.”
“No, you must be feeling something, Suzuna. Come on, tell me.”
“W-Well…”
I don’t want to say it.
And how does she know?
It’s embarrassing to tell Riri-chan that she’s the reason for this.
“Don’t think you can keep secrets from me! There’s no way I’d miss you doing something so unusual, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan put her arm around my shoulders again.
“N-No… it’s really nothing.”
“Hmm. You’re being very stubborn today. You really don’t want to tell me?”
Riri-chan’s arm tightened around me.
She moved closer, and I felt like we’d be touching if I moved even slightly.
“I’m not being stubborn…”
“And since when did you become so close with Kanaori? I wasn’t told anything about this.”
Riri-chan’s voice dropped a tone.
I sensed some dark emotion in her voice.
“No, she just talked to me.”
“Hmm. So you’re not denying that you became closer. Hmm, so you made a friend besides me?”
It was a question, but it also sounded like an accusation.
But wait a minute.
I wouldn’t call my relationship with Kanaori-san a friendship yet, but I should be allowed to become close with other people.
“Is that not allowed?”
“It’s not that it’s not allowed, but… it bothers me. I don’t like that your relationship progressed without me.”
It’s arrogant of her to try to know everything about me.
“…You have Tachibana-san and the others, Riri-chan.”
“Why are you suddenly bringing up Kaede?”
It’s strange that she’s so focused on me when she has friends like Tachibana Kaede, who’s also popular.
“You’re close with Tachibana-san, and you were having fun playing volleyball with her. So it’s unfair that you’re criticizing me for getting a little closer to Kanaori-san.”
“…”
…Ah, I messed up.
I spoke more emotionally than I intended.
My tone was too strong.
That’s probably why Riri-chan fell silent.
I ruined the mood.
Wh-What do I do?
“S-Sorry, Riri-chan, I didn’t mean—”
“Mufufu…”
“—Eh?”
Just as I resolved to apologize, Riri-chan giggled.
No, that’s a strange reaction.
“What, what, what? Suzuna, were you watching Kaede and me like that? Oh my, is someone jealous~?”
“Eh?! N-No, that’s not… it’s not like that…”
“So you started practicing volleyball because you didn’t like seeing Kaede and me having fun and standing out during P.E.? That’s why you couldn’t tell me.”
“I-I’m telling you it’s not like that…”
“Hmm? Really?”
“It’s true!”
“Suzuna, your face is bright red~”
N-No way…
That’s definitely not true.
My face is burning, but it’s not visible to Riri-chan.
“M-Move away. You’re too close, Riri-chan!”
“It’s too late to run away now. That’s like saying, ‘You got me.’”
“That’s not true! I don’t know what you’re talking about! It’s just your imagination!”
I struggled, but Riri-chan was stronger, and I couldn’t escape.
“But you apologized earlier, didn’t you, Suzuna?”
“…That’s because…”
Riri-chan only asked; she didn’t accuse me of anything.
So I think I was wrong to raise my voice.
“You suddenly raised your voice at me, Suzuna. That hurt my feelings.”
“…I think I got too emotional too.”
“What should I do? Do you want me to forgive you?”
She made it sound like she might not forgive me.
“…Are you not going to forgive me?”
“I’ll give you one punishment. If you accept it, I’ll forgive you.”
“What is it?”
“Close your eyes.”
Th-This is scary…
What is she going to do?
Not knowing, but wanting to be forgiven, I closed my eyes.
“You’re so obedient and cute, Suzuna.”
“Stop saying weird things and just do it already.”
“Fine, fine.”
My vision was filled with darkness, and there was no sound.
Then, I felt something wet on my neck.
Like a drop of water trickling down my skin.
A lukewarm sensation, completely different from a fingertip.
What is this?
I was confused, unable to comprehend the unfamiliar sensation.
Curious about what she was doing, I opened my eyes slightly.
Riri-chan’s face was right next to my neck.
But there was one unexpected movement.
Riri-chan’s soft, red tongue darted out.
“Riri-chan, what are you doing?!”
I recoiled instinctively.
“Ah, Suzuna! You weren’t supposed to open your eyes!”
Riri-chan pulled her tongue back, sounding disappointed.
“Riri-chan, answer me!”
The sensation on my neck, the wetness…
That was…
“I licked you, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan replied casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
“Th-That doesn’t make sense! And right after we exercised!”
I’m all sweaty.
Licking my neck now is crazy.
If she’s going to lick me, at least do it when I’m clean… no, that’s not the point!
“You’re clean, Suzuna.”
“That’s not the issue!”
She’s a pervert, there’s a pervert here!
------------------ 
43 It Would Be Nice If We Felt the Same
“Hey, Suzuna, wait up!”
Riri-chan’s voice called out from behind me.
I was walking ahead, and Riri-chan was following.
“I won’t.”
“Why not?”
It’s obvious, isn’t it?
Because she suddenly licked my neck.
How am I supposed to face Riri-chan after that?
“Why don’t you put your hand on your chest and think about it?”
“It’s because you’re embarrassed, right?”
She answered instantly.
She definitely didn’t even put her hand on her chest.
She’s giving off a strong “I know what you’re thinking, Suzuna” vibe.
“…No, I’m not embarrassed.”
“There was a pause before you answered.”
“No one gets embarrassed from being licked.”
That would make it sound like I enjoyed it.
Normally, you’d be uncomfortable being licked.
That’s the correct reaction.
That’s why I’m angry.
What else could it be?
“I think I’m looking at one right now.”
“No, that’s just you, the perverted Riri-chan.”
A kiss on the cheek is still somewhat understandable.
But licking my neck has a different meaning.
It’s clearly not normal behavior.
“I think you’re the pervert, Suzuna, getting embarrassed from being licked.”
This person…
I’m denying it, so why is she so convinced that I’m embarrassed?
And it’s Riri-chan who’s the pervert, so it’s strange that she’s projecting it onto me.
“I am not a pervert.”
I stopped walking and turned around.
I actually wanted to go home alone, but if I ran away now, she’d probably label me a pervert, so I wanted to make it clear.
But Riri-chan just grinned.
“But, Suzuna, you didn’t tell me to stop, and you didn’t seem to hate it, even though you were surprised.”
“…W-Well, I wouldn’t say I hated it when you did it, Riri-chan.”
“Fufu, that means you accepted it, right?”
“But I wasn’t embarrassed. So I’m not a pervert. You’re the pervert for licking me.”
Yes, that’s sound logic.
I’m not saying anything strange.
But Riri-chan’s confident smile didn’t falter.
“And you seem to be forgetting, but this was a punishment game, remember? It’s only natural that you’d be subjected to something slightly unpleasant.”
“Wh-What…?”
That’s such a sneaky way of putting it.
Riri-chan was the one who suggested the punishment game and decided on the content.
She’s trying to justify her actions by using the punishment game as a shield.
“So it can’t be helped, can it?”
“That’s not fair, Riri-chan, that’s not a valid excuse.”
“It’s your fault for being embarrassed, Suzuna.”
“I’m telling you, I wasn’t embarrassed! Anyone would react that way! You don’t understand how I feel because you haven’t been on the receiving end.”
That’s right.
Anyone would be flustered if they were suddenly licked like that.
Riri-chan doesn’t understand because it’s never happened to her.
“Hmm, is that so?”
“Yes, that’s why you don’t understand, Riri-chan.”
Only the victim understands the victim’s feelings.
It’s common sense.
Even if the perpetrator tries to explain it, it’s just conjecture.
“Then tell me, Suzuna.”
“…Yes?”
“Why don’t you do the same to me? Then I’ll admit that I’m not a pervert if I react the same way.”
“…D-Don’t say such ridiculous things.”
Does she even understand what she’s saying?
“So you are a pervert, Suzuna.”
“W-Wait a minute! Why would you think that?!”
“Because there’s no way to verify it. I even gave you an idea to find out, but you refused, so it can’t be helped if I call you a pervert, right?”
How much does she want to call me a pervert…?
She’s probably assuming that I won’t do it.
W-Well, I won’t lose…
“Fine, I’ll show you.”
“Eh? You don’t have to force yourself. You can just admit that you’re a pervert.”
“I’m not forcing myself! I’m just going to teach you, the clueless Riri-chan, the truth.”
That’s right, this is an educational experience for the ignorant Riri-chan.
It’s a friend’s duty to correct them when they’re doing something strange.
So this is a necessary act.
“Come on, now.”
“Hmm, you’re serious. Then, here you go.”
Riri-chan closed her eyes.
Why is she so readily accepting this…?
Anyway, I have to do it.
To recreate the situation, I approached silently.
I moved my face closer to Riri-chan’s fair neck.
Just as I was about to stick out my tongue and touch her skin, I stopped.
…Wait, if I do exactly the same thing, it won’t be a true recreation, will it?
I was completely unaware of what was about to happen when she suddenly licked my neck.
But Riri-chan knows what’s about to happen.
Then she won’t truly understand how I felt.
So I should choose a different spot.
But where?
I already kissed her cheek, so there’s no element of surprise.
Her forehead is too cliché.
Her lips are… no, no way.
My gaze naturally drifted downwards.
Below her neck, her exposed chest.
I could see her collarbone.
…This is it.
Unexpected, yet within reasonable bounds.
Riri-chan should be able to understand my feelings if I do this.
I moved my face closer to her chest, my cheek brushing against the collar of her shirt.
Ignoring that, I stuck out my tongue again.
My tongue touched the hollow of her collarbone.
“Eh, ah…?”
A surprised gasp escaped Riri-chan’s lips.
As expected. I continued without hesitation.
The softness of her skin and flesh, the hardness of her bone, transmitted through my tongue.
I moved my tongue upwards, tracing the line of her collarbone.
As I licked her skin, Riri-chan’s sweet scent filled my nostrils.
A faint hint of sweat mixed with her fragrance.
“Nn… mm…”
Riri-chan let out another sound.
It sounded like a mixture of surprise and… something else, perhaps a ticklish sensation.
See? Now you understand how I felt.
I continued to extend my tongue—
“W-Wait, stop, Suzuna! Wh-Where are you licking?! That’s not my neck!”
Riri-chan’s flustered voice stopped me.
Satisfied, I pulled away.
“Surprised?”
“O-Of course I am! Why isn’t it my neck?!”
“Because if you knew where I was going to lick, you wouldn’t truly understand how I felt.”
“Th-That’s the reason…?”
Fufu, even Riri-chan seems quite surprised.
Her blushing face is proof of that.
Now she should understand my feelings a little better.
“See? Anyone would react that way if they were licked like that. Now you’ll admit that I’m not a pervert, right?”
“No, you’re definitely the pervert, Suzuna! That’s confirmed now!”
Riri-chan grabbed the collar of her shirt and clutched it tightly.
It was an unusual gesture for Riri-chan, who usually has her chest exposed, a gesture of self-protection.
“…Why? Riri-chan, just because you lost the argument doesn’t mean you can resort to such nonsense.”
“Licking my collarbone is way too advanced! I wasn’t expecting something that sophisticated!”
“Eh…”
Riri-chan’s flustered and blushing face was cute, but apparently, I did something strange.
It seems like it’s better not to do things I’m not used to.
44 Wanting to Know More
“…”
“…”
Silence between the two of us.
The usual walk home was filled with an awkward silence.
Or rather, it was because Riri-chan stopped talking.
Riri-chan usually talks to me about various things, but without that, the silence became unbearable.
“…Riri-chan.”
“Wh-What?”
“This silence is killing me…”
“You have the courage to say that, but not the courage to start a conversation yourself…”
Riri-chan scratched her cheek, looking troubled.
“Sorry, are you… angry…?”
Apparently, I did something strange.
And Riri-chan seems to have fallen silent because of it.
Maybe I upset her.
“No, I’m not angry. I wouldn’t be angry about something like this.”
“I-I see. Then say something.”
The silence made me feel like I had upset her, and I was restless.
“Well… don’t worry too much about what happened with Kaede. We’ve just known each other for a long time, that’s all.”
“Ah, okay…”
“I didn’t mean to neglect you, Suzuna.”
“O-Of course not.”
Being told that directly made me blush…
We walked in silence for a while, and before I knew it, we arrived at the downtown area.
This is where Riri-chan and I part ways.
“See you tomorrow, Suzuna.”
“Yeah, bye-bye.”
We waved goodbye.
I walked home alone.
Riri-chan said I was jealous of Tachibana-san.
Jealousy means envy.
One type of jealousy is “the feeling of resentment towards someone who is superior to you.”
Tachibana-san is beautiful, glamorous, and good at sports.
She’s far superior to me.
But am I envious? Honestly, I’m not sure.
There are countless people who are better than me.
There’s no end to envy if I keep comparing myself to others.
Then it must be the other meaning of jealousy: “the feeling you have when someone you care about shows affection towards someone else.”
But that’s also strange.
Because that would mean I like Riri-chan.
The affection that jealousy refers to is “romantic love,” not “friendship.”
So that’s impossible.
…But why does my chest ache every time I deny it?
An intangible emotion continues to wander within my heart.
◇◇◇
“Suzuna, you’ve changed a lot, haven’t you?”
Shindo-kun said the next morning at school.
“I-Is that so…?”
“Yeah, you suddenly started hanging out with Hinase Riri, and you’ve become friendly with Kokona, even though you used to be at odds with her. And lately, you seem to be close with Kanaori Reika too.”
“…Well, yeah.”
“What’s with your flashy social circle? Has the quiet, unassuming Suzuna who was only nice to me disappeared?”
It can’t be helped since I’m no longer the Amatsuki Suzuna you know.
Though I’m still quiet and unassuming.
“You don’t come to pick me up in the morning anymore, you don’t make me lunch, you don’t help me with my studies, and you don’t introduce me to your girlfriends. What’s up with that, as my childhood friend?”
No, what’s up with your demands, as my childhood friend?
Those are all things you should take care of yourself.
…Well, I do feel responsible for the “girlfriend” part.
“But you haven’t been in the classroom during lunch break lately, Shindo-kun. Where are you eating?”
I’m curious about his whereabouts.
“Lately, I’ve been buying lunch at the school store and eating in the hall or the courtyard. Today, I’m thinking of changing things up and eating on the rooftop.”
“…Excuse me?”
This protagonist… I thought he’d been absent lately, but he’s been wandering around all these places?
And his “girlfriend” should be on the rooftop.
The timing is perfect.
“I’m going too.”
“Huh…? It’s fine, but why?”
“There should be a senpai there, Shindo-kun. Talk to her.”
“What are you talking about? Talking to a senpai I don’t even know is impossible.”
“No, you have to talk to her!”
Otherwise, the event won’t happen.
“I’m telling you, it’s crazy to talk to a senpai I don’t know.”
“It’s not crazy. If you don’t talk to her now, you’ll never get a girlfriend, Shindo-kun.”
“…Huh?”
“She’s a potential girlfriend for you.”
The girl on the rooftop is the final heroine.
But Shindo-kun froze.
…He doesn’t believe me, huh?
“Wait for me, my future wife!”
Ah, well, that was unexpectedly simpleminded.
◇◇◇
This is how Shindo Minato meets the final heroine.
◇◇◇
A girl with a melancholic expression gazed at the sky on the rooftop.
She sighed, weary of her boring, repetitive daily life.
“I wish something interesting would happen…”
—BAM
As if in answer to her words, the door opened with a bang.
The girl turned around in surprise. Students rarely came to the rooftop at this time of year.
“Damn it… every single day… being chased by a gal, my little sister, and the student council president… what is this life?!”
The words uttered by the seemingly innocent boy were strangely out of place.
The girl became interested in him.
“Hmm? You’re being chased?”
“Eh, ah, I didn’t know anyone was here… Sorry, I’ll leave.”
The shy boy, realizing she was his senpai, tried to retreat.
“Wait, keep me company.”
“…Um, are you talking to me?”
“Yeah, I’m talking to you.”
“Excuse me, but I don’t understand why.”
The girl smiled.
“Because you seem interesting.”
◇◇◇
…Well, that’s how it’s supposed to go.
The previous heroines’ encounters were altered by my influence, but this encounter is a simple meeting between two people.
So if I recreate this scene, the heroine should be interested.
“…So, Shindo-kun, let’s put our plan into action.”
“O-Okay.”
During lunch break, Shindo-kun and I arrived at the rooftop entrance.
I managed to slip away from Riri-chan with a convincing excuse.
She might be angry if she finds out, but it can’t be helped this time.
Because this is our last chance.
I can’t miss this opportunity.
I carefully opened the door and peeked through the gap.
…There she was.
A girl with short blue hair, looking at the sky.
She’s definitely the final heroine.
“Okay, Shindo-kun, do exactly as I said.”
“…I understand, but… are you sure this will work?”
“I’m sure. I can see the future.”
“…Seriously?”
“Seriously.”
I’ve played the original game, after all.
And there have been no irregularities this time.
I stood by the door and listened.
“I wish something interesting would happen…”
Yes, the heroine’s introductory line.
“Go, Shindo-kun.”
“O-Okay!”
—BAM
Shindo-kun, urged by me, opened the door.
He took a deep breath and…
“DAMN IT… EVERY SINGLE DAY… BEING CHASED BY A GAL… MY LITTLE SISTER… AND THE STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT… WHAT IS THIS LIFE?!”
He delivered an incredibly over-the-top performance…
What is he doing?
“…?”
The heroine, turning around, stared at the suddenly appearing ham actor.
“…”
“…”
A few seconds of heavy silence.
—Click
Unable to bear it, Shindo-kun closed the door and crouched down.
“Shindo-kun, what are you doing?! You ruined it!”
“That’s my line! That’s not how it’s supposed to go at all! She gave me the coldest stare!”
“That’s because your acting was so bad!”
“Of course it was! Saying such nonsensical lies to a senpai is so embarrassing! I deserve praise for even attempting it!”
Damn it…
That was the problem.
The altered facts made Shindo-kun’s line lose its impact.
That’s why the heroine wasn’t interested.
“Ah, seriously! It would have worked if you had just played the part properly, Shindo-kun! You should have trusted me!”
“No, that was too much. Saying those light novel protagonist-like lines convincingly is crazy.”
“That’s his line, though!”
“Huh? I would never say that. Suzuna, are you glitching?”
—Glitch.
That word gave me pause.
But this isn’t the time for that.
“I know it would have worked if Shindo-kun had just said it properly. That senpai would have fallen for him.”
And yet, this guy…
No, there’s still a chance if I can attract her attention another way.
“Hmm? I would have fallen for him?”
…Eh?
A calm, low-pitched girl’s voice.
I looked up, and a girl with blue hair was looking down at us.
“I’d like to hear more about that.”
…This is bad.
She definitely overheard us.
I have no choice but to run…
“Wait, keep me company.”
The heroine called out to me.
I have a bad feeling about this.
“…Um, are you talking to me?”
“Yeah, I’m talking to you.”
“I don’t understand why.”
The girl smiled.
“Because you seem interesting.”
Her name is Futaba Yuu.
The last one, the senpai heroine.
------------------ 
45 I Want to Know More
Futaba Yuu.
Her blue, short hair flowed smoothly, and she had a tall, slender figure.
Her almond-shaped eyes and mature demeanor gave her an androgynous aura.
And she seemed interested in me, saying I seemed “interesting.”
This was as expected, but…
“What’s your name?”
Apparently, she wants me to introduce myself.
I’d be happy to.
“Shindo-kun, introduce yourself.”
“Ah, well, I’m Shindo—”
“Thank you, but I was asking the girl.”
That didn’t work.
Apparently, she’s interested in me, not Shindo-kun.
I don’t understand why.
“I’m Amatsuki Suzuna…”
“Suzuna-chan, huh? I’m Futaba Yuu.”
I know.
I know you well, since you’re also a heroine.
“So, what did you mean by me falling for him?”
“Shindo-kun here is a perfect match for you.”
I pointed at Shindo-kun next to me.
Futaba Yuu is a cool, melancholic girl, bored with her everyday life.
She should be immediately interested if she sees someone as interesting as him.
“Hello, I’m your future husband.”
Ah… this guy is really something.
No, maybe this will work.
He’s so strange that Futaba-san should be intrigued.
“…You’re joking, right?”
Ah, it didn’t work at all.
She’s probably turned off.
What are you doing, Shindo-kun?
“No, she’s the one who’s joking. She tricked me by saying she could see the future. She’s the root of all evil.”
“Hey, Shindo-kun, don’t blame me just because your joke flopped!”
“It’s the truth! You said she was a potential girlfriend, but she’s not even looking at me! I’m the victim here!”
This guy…
I’m trying to get him together with a heroine out of a sense of responsibility, and he’s pushing the blame onto me.
“Hmm, so Shindo-kun, you were instigated by Suzuna-chan?”
“Yes, that’s right. It’s all her scheme. If you want an apology for my rudeness, tell this girl. I, the victim, will be taking my leave.”
Saying that, Shindo-kun turned on his heel.
Wait, wait, what are you doing?
“Hey, why are you leaving?”
“You should apologize to your senpai for your rudeness. And to me later.”
After saying what he wanted to say, Shindo-kun went down the stairs.
I was left alone.
…This is awkward.
“So, why did you do this?”
Futaba-san looked at me, her smile unwavering.
“…Because you two are a good match.”
“You can say that even though you don’t know anything about each other?”
“I just know.”
“Fufu, you really are interesting.”
…Why am I being labeled as “interesting”?
I’m not the funny one.
“I think Shindo-kun is more interesting.”
“Hmm? No, he seems to lack confidence.”
She gave a unique reason.
It’s true that in the original story, Shindo Minato would have already formed a harem by now.
Shindo-kun, without that, might be lacking in confidence.
In that sense, her argument might be valid, but it’s also contradictory.
“If you’re interested in someone confident, then I don’t think I’m your type.”
“Is that so? You seem somewhat confident to me.”
“…I’m telling you I’m not.”
“People are often unaware of their own qualities.”
Futaba Yuu’s insightful remarks are characteristic of her, but this is off the mark.
I’m not confident.
I’m the type of person who can’t be confident even if I want to.
So I wish she wouldn’t say such strange things.
“Um, I should go back now.”
“Really? That’s too bad, I wanted to talk more.”
No, there’s no point in talking to me.
I wanted Futaba Yuu to talk to Shindo Minato.
“Sorry, I’ll excuse myself.”
“Okay, see you later, Suzuna-chan.”
Futaba-san waved her long, slender arm.
I bowed slightly and left the rooftop.
…Nothing is going my way.
◇◇◇
“Well, well, Suzuna-san? Don’t you have something to tell me?”
Back in the classroom, Riri-chan was waiting for me, sitting with her legs crossed, her bento box open on my desk.
“…Sorry I’m late.”
“You are, aren’t you? What were you doing?”
“I was… submitting a late assignment to the staff room…”
That was the excuse I used to get away from Riri-chan.
“It takes at most three minutes to walk to the staff room, six minutes round trip. So why did it take you thirty minutes?”
This is bad.
She’s angry, Riri-chan is angry.
Should I tell her the truth…?
No, if she finds out I was with Shindo-kun and another heroine, she’ll be even angrier.
Riri-chan hates being neglected.
“Um… the teacher asked me to do something else.”
“Hmm? What?”
“Uh… well, right before I was about to ask, the teacher got a phone call, and I had to wait until they finished.”
Th-That was close…
I somehow managed to come up with a plausible excuse.
“What? That’s terrible. Didn’t they say anything?”
“No, they apologized. They thought I had already left.”
“Huh? Then they should have told you from the beginning. This is why I hate inconsiderate adults.”
“W-Well… I was also being… obedient and waited.”
“It can’t be helped, Suzuna. Actually, you’re amazing for waiting so patiently.”
“R-Really? Ehehe…”
Alright!
I managed to deceive her.
Now, if I can just have a peaceful lunch—
“By the way…”
“Hmm?”
“I said six minutes round trip, but you walk pretty fast, Suzuna. So I thought it was strange after five minutes.”
“…You were timing me?”
I didn’t know she had such a meticulous side.
“And you don’t really like adults, Suzuna. I know because I’m the same, so I thought there’s no way you’d stay in the staff room for that long.”
“…Well, it was agonizing.”
What is she trying to say?
Why is she digging into a resolved issue? This kind of pettiness isn’t like her.
“So, ten minutes after you left the classroom, I went to the staff room.”
My blood ran cold.
“You weren’t there, even though I waited for thirty minutes. Was my eyesight bad?”
“…Uh, um…”
I desperately tried to suppress my trembling knees.
“Ah, I asked all the teachers who were there, and they said they didn’t see you come to the staff room.”
Th-This is impossible…
There’s no room for excuses.
“Suzuna, I’ll ask you one more time. Don’t you have something to tell me?”
“I… I have something to report.”
It goes without saying that I was severely scolded by Riri-chan after that.
46 Grant Me a Wish
I calmly explained what happened on the rooftop, trying to be objective and hiding my true intentions.
However, after being thoroughly scolded by Riri-chan, I realized there was little time left of lunch break.
“You really do fuss over Shindo a lot, Suzuna.”
“Ah, no, it’s not like that.”
We were eating our belated lunch.
Riri-chan still seemed to have more to say. While she wasn’t angry anymore, she continued to grumble.
“I know you’re childhood friends and close, but you never usually interact with anyone like that, Suzuna.”
“…I don’t want to do that either, if I can help it.”
I don’t want to interact with him at all, but Shindo-kun just wouldn’t get along with the other heroines, so I ended up getting involved.
I have to interact with him now to avoid interacting with him in the future.
It’s ironic, but I can’t laugh about it.
“Then don’t.”
“There’s such a thing as… a complicated relationship, you know? It’s like that.”
A relationship that will eventually be severed.
“Hmm… well, I’m not happy about it.”
Riri-chan often gets upset when I interact with other heroines or Shindo-kun.
The source of that emotion was a bit of a mystery.
But lately, I’ve started to understand.
The feeling I had when I saw Riri-chan and Tachibana-san together.
Riri-chan called it “jealousy.”
Since she used that term herself, there’s no doubt that she also feels that emotion.
“Riri-chan, is that… jealousy?”
Riri-chan froze at my question.
“J-Jealousy…? Why would you think that?”
“Because when we were talking about you playing volleyball with Tachibana-san, you said it was jealousy…”
“…Ah, I see. So my own words came back to bite me…”
Riri-chan made a troubled expression.
“What would you think if I said it was jealousy, Suzuna?”
“…Eh?”
What would happen if she said it was jealousy?
Jealousy, or envy, is a feeling you have towards someone you “admire” or someone you have “romantic feelings” for.
But Riri-chan would never admire me.
Then… romantic feelings…?
No, that’s ridiculous.
Riri-chan is supposed to fall for Shindo Minato.
Even if she doesn’t have feelings for him now, could those feelings shift to someone else other than the protagonist?
Even if that were possible, there’s no way she’d have those feelings for me.
“Ahaha… no, don’t think about it so seriously. It was just a hypothetical.”
Riri-chan laughed lightheartedly, trying to dispel the awkward atmosphere.
“You’re right… it was a hypothetical.”
“Exactly. I was just teasing you about Kaede. I didn’t think you’d take it so seriously.”
That’s right… there’s no way.
I’m bad at communication, so I take everything literally, even jokes.
“Sorry, I don’t understand those kinds of things.”
“I’m just worried about you, Suzuna.”
“Worried?”
“Yeah, because you’re kind, Suzuna. I’m worried that other people might take advantage of you.”
…I’m not particularly kind.
But I don’t mind being worried about by Riri-chan.
“I see. I’m sorry for making you worry.”
“It’s fine.”
“But I feel bad, so…”
“Well, it wasn’t good that you neglected our lunch break.”
“Y-Yeah… I’ll do anything as an apology.”
Riri-chan froze again.
“A-Anything…?”
“Well, within reason.”
I can only grant very small wishes.
But I thought it would make Riri-chan feel better if I did something, rather than nothing.
It’s the least I can do to atone.
“A-Anything…? Anything means… anything, right…?”
Riri-chan suddenly raised her voice.
I think this is a normal conversation between friends, but is it different?
“S-Suzuna, you sometimes drop bombshells, so I can’t underestimate you…”
“Is that so…?”
Is this really such a surprising thing?
…No, I don’t think it is.
Riri-chan seemed deep in thought.
“Calm down, calm down… I can’t rush into this…”
She muttered something.
“Ah, you probably don’t have any wishes for me, anyway.”
“I do! I have plenty! It’s just that there are too many to choose from.”
“Really…?”
“Yeah, I’m worried they might make you hate me.”
“H-Hate me…?”
What is she imagining me asking her to do…?
She’s not thinking of anything weird, is she…?
Riri-chan pondered, weighing various options.
“Okay, I’ve got it. Suzuna, are you free tomorrow?”
Tomorrow is Saturday, so there’s no school.
I don’t have anything to do, since I’m not in any clubs and don’t have any friends.
“I’m free.”
“Great! Then come shopping with me tomorrow.”
“Shopping…?”
“Yeah, I could go alone, but it’s more fun with someone. I want to go with you, Suzuna.”
“I’m fine with that.”
Or rather, it’s such a simple request.
I would have gone even if she hadn’t made it a wish.
“Ehehe, then it’s settled!”
Riri-chan’s expression finally softened.
She’s been frowning since we returned to the classroom, so I’m glad she’s cheered up.
“I’ll let you know the time later.”
“O-Okay. And where are we going?”
“Just shopping in town. So can we meet at my house?”
“Okay—”
Wait.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
That means we’ll be in casual clothes, not our uniforms.
Wouldn’t that make the difference between Riri-chan and me even more obvious, creating an unbearable situation?
Ah, this is bad.
It’s an obvious thing, yet I’m getting nervous…
“Riri-chan, can I make a suggestion?”
“What?”
“How about we both wear tracksuits so we can easily recognize each other when we meet?”
“Absolutely not.”
“…I figured.”
What clothes do I even have in my closet…?
The childhood friend is the losing heroine.
I think Amatsuki Suzuna’s casual clothes were also unremarkable…
And I, Yukitsuki Mashiro, have terrible fashion sense, so I don’t even know what to wear.
I couldn’t stop sighing.
------------------ 
47 Customer Service is Scary
The sky was clear, and the temperature was moderate, hinting at the end of spring and the arrival of summer.
The wind might be a little cool, but it would probably get warmer around noon.
A perfect day to go out.
“…Sigh…”
And yet, my mood was as gloomy as the weather was bright.
Nothing particularly bad happened.
But the future that awaited me filled me with endless sighs.
“Ah, Suzuna! You’re early.”
A bright, cheerful voice, as radiant as the sun.
It was Riri-chan, waving at me with a smile.
She was wearing a natural-colored jacket and skirt, a white inner shirt, black sneakers, and a square shoulder bag slung across her body.
Her skirt was short, revealing her legs, but that was typical Riri-chan, and it was somehow reassuring.
Her makeup was also more defined than usual. She looked very fashionable and cute, even more radiant than usual.
A beautiful girl who would catch anyone’s eye.
“Ah, no, I just got here.”
I waved back and replied.
“…Suzuna?”
Riri-chan suddenly stopped.
“Yes?”
“…Um, you do know what we’re doing today, right?”
“Going shopping with you, Riri-chan.”
Riri-chan’s gaze kept moving up and down.
Just like I was looking at her casual clothes, she’s probably looking at mine.
“…You’re not… planning on going to the convenience store, are you?”
Her tone was vague, but she seemed to be struggling to say something.
“No, but I thought we’d be walking a lot in town, so I chose functional clothes.”
I’m not fashionable like Riri-chan, so I prioritized practicality.
Nothing too flashy, nothing too drab. No criticism, no praise.
A perfect balance, or so I thought.
“…Wh-Why are you wearing a sweatsuit?”
“You said I couldn’t wear a tracksuit.”
“…D-Didn’t you consider anything else?”
“Well, if I’m choosing based on functionality after tracksuits, I thought this was the next best thing.”
“Um, I don’t… usually hear the word ‘functionality’ used for clothes…”
“Really? But even though you might not think of them that way, if you trace the history of sweatshirts, they started as sportswear, and—”
“U-Um, wait a minute. People also don’t usually say ‘trace the history,’ you know?”
Oh dear…
Riri-chan seems to have a lot to say about my outfit.
Could it be that I made a mistake, despite choosing such a safe option?
“Is this outfit… bad…?”
“N-No, it’s not bad! It’s not bad, but… it’s not really something you wear when you go shopping in town…”
Ah… I failed.
I really am hopeless.
“I thought it was a safe coordinate, all black, with matching colors…”
“Ah, well… it’s safe in a sense. But it’s a bit… heavy for spring/summer clothes…”
S-Season…?
Do I have to consider the season when choosing colors…?
I can’t keep up.
“I see… Since it’s you, Riri-chan, I’ll ask, is there anything else wrong?”
“…Why are you wearing boots?”
Oh, that’s wrong too?
Wait, wait, hold on.
I thought this was okay.
I didn’t know what shoes to wear, so I searched online, and I settled on these black boots.
“The internet said, ‘Complete a casual outfit with leather shoes.’”
“…No, you’re not wrong. You’re not wrong, but… it’s… not quite right.”
Riri-chan finally looked up at the sky.
She’s given up, I guess.
I’m not wrong, but I’m apparently wrong.
What’s with fashion?
“Sorry, I guess I’m not worthy of walking next to you, Riri-chan.”
I’m only embarrassing her further.
Even the most brilliant diamond looks bad in a shabby box.
I’m tarnishing Riri-chan’s brilliance.
“N-No, it’s not that you’re not worthy…”
“I’ve never seen you choose your words so carefully, Riri-chan. It must be really bad.”
Riri-chan, who usually speaks her mind, was being incredibly considerate.
That’s also mentally damaging.
I’ll just leave…
“Let’s go buy some clothes together.”
“…Eh?”
“I’ll choose some clothes for you.”
Riri-chan smiled.
S-So that means…
“We’re going to a clothing store?”
“Yes, but…?”
“…But you have to do your own shopping, Riri-chan.”
“No, I wanted to look at clothes too, so it works out perfectly.”
I-I see…
Well, then I have no choice but to go.
I promised to accompany her.
“Come on, let’s go.”
“O-Okay!”
Riri-chan took my hand.
Riri-chan, in light and airy colors, and me, in heavy, dark colors.
I wonder if we, a contrasting pair, will blend in with the cityscape.
◇◇◇
“How about this?”
I followed Riri-chan into a building.
Clothing brands lined the floors.
It seemed to be a women’s fashion floor, as all the clothes on display were for women, and most of the customers were female.
She said, “I think this store might have something that suits you, Suzuna,”
And we entered the store, but…
“Suzuna, are you listening?”
“Ah, yeah…”
Riri-chan picked up one outfit after another, asking, “How about this?” in rapid succession.
She was holding a white dress.
“So, what do you think? Is this okay?”
“…Y-Yeah, I guess.”
Honestly, I don’t know.
I think the dress is cute, but I’m not sure if I can wear it. It feels wrong.
I don’t think such a frilly and innocent outfit suits me.
And more than anything…
“Would you like to try it on?”
There it is…!
Customer service…!
And she’s recommending I try it on…!
“Suzuna, do you want to try it on?”
“Ah, um…”
No, I’m embarrassed.
It’s a waste for someone like me to wear such lovely clothes. It’s not appropriate for me.
And after I try it on, the shop assistant will come and shower me with insincere compliments.
Before I know it, they’ll create an atmosphere where I have no choice but to buy it, and I’ll end up buying it without really understanding why.
Ah, this is painful.
“I-Is this dress… sold online…?”
I whispered to Riri-chan.
“Hmm? It’s a famous brand, so you should be able to find it if you search online.”
“Then let’s buy it online. So I don’t have to try it on, right?”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened, and she raised her voice.
“You don’t want to try it on even though it’s right here? What about the size?”
“I’ll just… go with the vibe.”
“No way, the size makes a big difference.”
“But this sweatsuit is big, and I don’t really mind…”
“Don’t compare it to that! Just try it on.”
“Ehhh…”
I was pushed towards the fitting room by Riri-chan.
Clothing stores are a huge hurdle for introverts…
48 Just Trust Me: Hinase Riri’s Side
Fufu…
Things took an unexpected turn, and I managed to secure a promise from Suzuna.
She generally doesn’t like going out.
And I know she’s even less inclined to do so on holidays.
She’ll probably come with me if I insist, but I’ve held back until now, worried that she might start to dislike me.
But this time, Suzuna gave me an excuse.
I can’t miss this golden opportunity.
This is a date.
I don’t know what Suzuna thinks, but this is a date.
Thinking that, I naturally put more effort into getting ready.
I often go out in casual clothes, but I can’t let Suzuna see me like that on our date.
I took out a new set of shirt and skirt that I bought but never had the chance to wear.
Today is the perfect day to wear this.
I also spent more time than usual on my hair and makeup.
“Alright, Suzuna, I’m coming!”
My heart fluttered with excitement for my first holiday spent with Suzuna, and I opened the door.
◇◇◇
Ten minutes before our appointed time, I left my apartment and saw that Suzuna was already waiting.
She’s earlier than I expected.
I’m a little disappointed that I wasn’t the one waiting first.
But I was happy to see her so soon.
“Suzuna, you’re early!”
I waved at Suzuna.
She noticed me right away and shyly waved back, but…
I froze.
“Ah, no, I just got here.”
Suzuna was saying something, but I couldn’t process it.
I was too distracted by her outfit.
“…W-Why are you wearing a sweatsuit?”
Suzuna was wearing a black sweatsuit from head to toe.
With her black hair, she was just… black.
Like she was absorbing all the sunlight.
I thought she’d dress up a little more…
When I asked her why, she said she chose it for “functionality.”
No, no, I’m not looking for “functionality” in girls’ clothes. Or rather, I don’t use that word.
Suzuna continues to express her unique worldview in strange ways.
And I just noticed she’s wearing black leather boots.
No, no, you don’t wear boots with a sweatsuit.
When I asked her about that too, she said,
“The internet said, ‘Complete a casual outfit with leather shoes.’”
Apparently, it was based on internet knowledge.
This is a cautionary tale about the dangers of not properly understanding what you read online.
But this is also the result of Suzuna trying her best.
I’m happy that she even thought about it, and the fact that it turned out strangely is endearing.
I don’t understand how this could happen.
I looked up at the sky.
…Someone, please stop this cute creature’s rampage.
◇◇◇
So, I came to buy clothes with Suzuna.
I pushed Suzuna, who for some reason hated trying on clothes, into the fitting room.
“Riri-chan, I’ll try it on, but promise you won’t laugh if it doesn’t suit me…”
A faint voice came from behind the curtain.
“I won’t! It’ll suit you, Suzuna, so don’t worry.”
“…I wonder. I feel like it’ll be a comedy show.”
I heard the rustling of clothes as she grumbled.
Sometimes, I think Suzuna’s self-deprecation is excessive.
She often puts herself down and over-praises me, creating an imbalance.
She seems to lack confidence in almost everything and is always trying to read the room.
Even now, just trying on clothes, she’s being negative, saying it won’t suit her.
Suzuna is slender, so she looks better than me, with my curvier figure.
I think it’s stranger to wear a baggy, all-black sweatsuit.
“Riri-chan… I don’t think this is good…”
Suzuna peeked her head out of the fitting room curtain without opening it.
She was frowning, looking anxious.
“I can’t tell if I don’t see it.”
“I saw it.”
“I mean I haven’t seen it.”
“…Seriously?”
Suzuna was being so hesitant.
She’s still resisting, even after coming this far.
It’s endearing, but I also want to see a different side of Suzuna.
“Just show me.”
—Swish
I forcefully opened the curtain.
“Whoa…”
There was Suzuna, flustered, in an ivory dress.
Her arms and legs were slender, her waist was trim, and the dress complemented her fair skin.
“No way, it’s super cute!”
“…You’re just pitying me because I look so ridiculous. I’m not falling for it.”
She laughed self-deprecatingly, using complicated words.
She’s such a stubborn child.
“Stop being so negative and just accept it for once.”
“I’m not being negative.”
“You’re deliberately avoiding it. Do you hate being called cute that much?”
“Because I’m not cute.”
Suzuna turned away, blushing.
What’s with this girl? She’s trying to act aloof, but she can’t hide her embarrassment.
“Hypothetically, let’s say someone thought you weren’t cute. Which is impossible.”
“That’s a fact.”
“Hypothetically!”
She’s so stubborn.
“But does that matter?”
“…What are you trying to say?”
“As long as you like it, it doesn’t matter what other people think.”
“Hmm…”
Suzuna, seemingly at a loss for words, kept fiddling with the hem of her dress.
“But… I don’t think I look cute…”
I see, Suzuna really is insecure.
I’m not always confident either, but there are times when I like myself.
It’s a waste to constantly put yourself down without ever experiencing those moments.
“I think you’re cute, so isn’t that enough?”
“Eh…?”
“It doesn’t matter what other people think. I think you’re cute. Just trust me, Suzuna.”
“But…”
“Don’t you trust me, Suzuna?”
It might be manipulative, but this is what it takes for Suzuna to acknowledge herself.
“…I trust you.”
Suzuna mumbled.
“Then it’s fine, isn’t it?”
“…Yeah.”
Suzuna finally nodded.
Suzuna is stubborn, but she listens to me.
That makes her even more endearing.
“How are we doing?”
“Hmph!”
—Swish!
Suzuna closed the curtain as soon as she heard the shop assistant’s voice.
“Um, excuse me…?”
The shop assistant looked bewildered, unsure of the situation.
…She probably doesn’t want to be seen.
“Ah, she wants to… try on something else…?”
I made up an excuse on the spot.
“I-I see. Please let me know if you need anything.”
The shop assistant bowed and left, still looking slightly puzzled.
I turned back to the closed curtain.
“Suzuna? It’s fine to let them see, you know?”
“…I told you.”
“Eh, what?”
I couldn’t understand her muffled words from behind the curtain.
Then Suzuna peeked her head out again.
“You said, ‘Just trust me,’ Riri-chan.”
“I did, but…?”
“Then there’s no need to show anyone else.”
So that means…
She’ll show me because she trusts me, and she won’t show anyone else because she doesn’t trust them?
“…I see.”
“And I would never show anyone else this embarrassing outfit besides you, Riri-chan, so please think before you talk to the shop assistant.”
“…Sorry.”
“Seriously, get a grip, Riri-chan.”
She turned away and went back behind the curtain.
Suzuna’s tsundere behavior made me swoon.
------------------ 
49 You Can Do What You Want
Unable to resist Riri-chan’s persistence, I became a dress-up doll.
As she kept suggesting different outfits, the dress that didn’t suit me at first started to look… okay.
People get used to things, I guess.
“So, what do you think? Is this okay?”
“It’s… okay, I guess…”
“Well, you don’t have to force yourself. I just wanted to show you that you can pull off this kind of style too, Suzuna.”
…That’s what she said.
Well, if Riri-chan insists, I’ll believe her.
I changed back into my black sweatsuit and left the fitting room.
I was about to take the dress to the cashier, but…
“Suzuna, it goes over there.”
Riri-chan pointed to where the dress originally was.
“Hmm? Aren’t you buying it?”
I tilted my head, not understanding what she meant.
“Eh, you’re buying it?”
“Well, yeah.”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened.
It wasn’t cheap, but it was within my budget.
Amatsuki Suzuna, who rarely spends money, has quite a bit of savings.
“You don’t have to force yourself. You can choose something else if you like.”
“…You said it suited me, Riri-chan, so this is fine. I like this one.”
Or rather, I don’t have any particular style I like.
What Riri-chan says is good is good enough for me.
She should be aware of that.
As I was thinking that, Riri-chan looked up at the ceiling again.
…What is she doing, looking at the ceiling?
“Suzuna, what are you doing to me?”
Riri-chan suddenly hugged me.
Wait, wait, wait!
“Riri-chan, we’re in a store!”
“Ah, we can’t do this in public.”
That doesn’t mean it’s okay if no one’s around.
For some reason, Riri-chan was so happy she looked like she was about to start dancing.
“So, why don’t you change into it after we buy it?”
“…Seriously?”
“Seriously. Why wouldn’t you?”
“I’m fine with it, Riri-chan, but I’m not sure about… being seen in this by strangers…”
I know no one is paying attention to me, but I still feel embarrassed.
“Honestly, I think it’s more embarrassing to be seen in that sweatsuit…”
“Is that so?”
“It is.”
She sounded slightly exasperated.
“Okay…”
I have nothing else to believe in besides Riri-chan’s words.
I decided to listen to her.
I paid for the dress, borrowed a fitting room to change, and then we left the store.
“Suzuna, you’re so cute!”
And I was hugged again.
…What’s with her?
“Riri-chan.”
“Ah! Sorry, you’re just too cute.”
She’s saying things that sound like something a kidnapper would say.
But the light and airy fabric felt more comfortable than I expected.
The black sweatsuit, stuffed into the shopping bag, looked a little bulky.
“…I heard sweatshirts were functional, but was that a lie?”
“Suzuna, you’re banned from using that word for clothes.”
I don’t understand why, but Riri-chan issued a ban.
◇◇◇
“What about your shopping, Riri-chan?”
At the previous store, Riri-chan was only looking at clothes for me; she didn’t seem to be looking for anything for herself.
“Ah, I forgot.”
“Why…?”
“I was too focused on you, Suzuna.”
Was the sweatsuit that bad?
“So what did you want to buy?”
“Um, I wanted to look at some miscellaneous goods.”
We went to a nearby general store.
It had a stylish exterior and various cute knick-knacks.
Riri-chan wandered around the store.
She seemed to be browsing aimlessly rather than looking for something specific.
“How about this?”
Riri-chan suddenly picked up a stuffed animal.
It looked like a rabbit, but its ears and limbs were quite short. And its head was disproportionately large.
It had an awkward, stubby appearance, but it was still cute as a stuffed animal.
“…Cute.”
I generally like stuffed animals.
In my previous life, I had so many that it was hard to tell if my room was mine or the stuffed animals’.
I’ve been holding back since becoming Amatsuki Suzuna, but maybe I can start collecting them again.
“Ahaha, right? I think so too.”
Riri-chan giggled and stroked the stuffed animal’s head.
I don’t understand fashion or anything, but I was happy that we seemed to have similar tastes in this area.
“You like these too, Riri-chan?”
Seeing her with the stuffed animal made me want to do the same, so I stroked it too.
The soft, short fur felt pleasant.
“Yeah, I think I like them. …But Kaede probably doesn’t like this kind of thing.”
“…”
Why did she bring up Tachibana-san’s name?
I stopped stroking the stuffed animal.
“Suzuna?”
Riri-chan put the stuffed animal back and peered at my face.
“…What’s wrong with Tachibana-san?”
“Ah, well, her birthday is coming up soon, so I was wondering what to get her.”
“Hmm…”
I see, it’s Tachibana-san’s birthday.
So that’s it.
Riri-chan’s main purpose today was to buy a birthday present for Tachibana-san.
“Um… sorry, I didn’t tell you.”
“Why are you apologizing?”
I know that Riri-chan and Tachibana-san are friends.
And Riri-chan told me not to worry about it.
It’s normal for friends to give each other presents; it’s not strange at all.
So it’s weird that Riri-chan is apologizing.
“No, it’s because you seem angry, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan made an apologetic expression.
I don’t understand.
There’s no reason for her to make that expression.
“I’m not angry.”
“No, you’re clearly acting differently.”
“I’m not.”
“No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…”
Riri-chan reached for my hand.
I instinctively pulled away.
“…You are angry.”
Riri-chan looked at me, troubled.
But I’m the one who’s troubled.
I’m acting normally, but Riri-chan is unilaterally treating me like I’m in a bad mood.
It’s making me actually feel bad.
“I’m going home.”
“Eh, come on, that’s not fair.”
I don’t like this.
I don’t like Riri-chan treating me like I’m fragile.
And I don’t like that she was thinking about Tachibana-san while trying to touch me.
Or rather, she might have been thinking about whether Tachibana-san would like this dress.
Presents can be clothes too.
So maybe I was just an afterthought from the beginning.
I don’t like that either.
“Whatever.”
“Suzuna, I’m sorry! I’m apologizing!”
“I’m not angry, so I don’t want you to apologize.”
“Then what am I supposed to do?”
“Nothing.”
I’m tired of this back and forth.
Riri-chan can just choose a present for Tachibana-san.
She can think about her close friend, choose a present, give it to her, and have a good time.
It has nothing to do with me.
It doesn’t.
I don’t need to get involved in something that has nothing to do with me.
My thoughts were jumbled, my emotions a mess, and I felt disgusted.
I wanted to leave this place and throw away these feelings.
50 All Alone
My stomach churns.
As if driven by some unseen force, I continued walking.
Not heading anywhere in particular, just blindly pushing through the crowd.
At first, I could hear Riri-chan’s voice, but before I knew it, it was gone.
I think I lost her somewhere.
That’s fine.
I don’t feel like talking to Riri-chan right now.
An unsettling feeling lingered in my chest, and I kept walking, trying to shake it off.
But nothing changed.
I didn’t understand what I was feeling or what I should do.
The fluttering of my dress irritated me.
—Thud
“Ouch…”
I bumped into someone.
“S-Sorry.”
My mind was a mess.
I apologized for bumping into her.
“I should also apologize for not looking where I was—going…?”
“Eh…”
It was a familiar voice.
Standing before me was Futaba Yuu, with her short blue hair, wearing a black shirt and a long gray skirt.
“It’s Suzuna-chan. What’s wrong? You seem flustered.”
“Futaba…-senpai. No, it’s nothing.”
“Really? Walking so fast for no reason… are you always this hasty?”
Her lighthearted, elusive way of speaking was irritating in my current state.
“Just leave me alone.”
“It’s fate that we met here, so tell me what’s wrong.”
“It’s a coincidence. And I have nothing to say.”
“But I can’t just leave you alone after seeing that expression on your face.”
“…What expression?”
I thought I was making my usual expression.
“You look… angry and sad.”
“…That’s a vague answer.”
If you name half of the human emotions, you’re bound to be right about something.
This person is unreliable.
“But it’s not wrong, is it?”
“It’s just my normal expression.”
“Come on, just talk about it. It might make you feel better.”
…This person is persistent.
She’s not listening to me at all.
“It’s faster to just talk and be done with it, rather than being pestered like this.”
“You shouldn’t say that about yourself.”
I want to escape from her too. I was too focused on getting away from Riri-chan.
My feet hurt from wearing these unfamiliar boots, so I can’t walk any faster.
I sighed.
“…I’ll leave as soon as I’m done talking.”
“That’s what I want to hear.”
It’s annoying that she’s getting her way.
◇◇◇
I sat down on a bench in a nearby park.
I explained what happened as concisely as possible.
“—Yeah, that’s jealousy.”
Futaba-senpai nodded solemnly.
Honestly, I’m tired of hearing that word.
Jealousy, envy…
Everyone uses those words so casually, but do they even know what they mean?
“That’s not true. Jealousy is a feeling you have when you love someone, right?”
“Hmm? Don’t you love her?”
“I don’t. She’s my friend.”
“That doesn’t matter.”
“…What do you mean?”
“There’s such a thing as platonic love. Friendship is surely a form of love.”
Isn’t that just wordplay?
Just because the word contains “love,” it’s not romantic love.
…Ugh, thinking about love is making my head spin.
“So you can be jealous even between friends.”
“…Do you experience that, Futaba-senpai?”
Since talking about definitions seemed to be causing a Gestaltzerfall, I simply asked if she had experienced it herself.
If there are other people who feel this way, I might feel a little better.
“I do. For example—”
Futaba-senpai moved closer, shortening the distance between us on the bench.
She didn’t look away, her gaze steady.
“—I’m jealous of the person who’s making you jealous, Suzuna-chan.”
“…Excuse me?”
Her voice was flat.
It was hard to tell if she was serious or joking with her calm demeanor.
“See? It happens to me too. You should be more honest with your feelings, Suzuna-chan.”
Futaba-senpai moved back to her original position.
“Are you saying I’m not being straightforward?”
“Yeah, you’re trying to hide your feelings, and that’s why you’re so tired. You should just accept them and put them into words.”
She spoke casually, but it felt condescending.
…Well, she is my senpai, so it’s only natural.
“And it might even be… true love.”
“I told you, that’s not true.”
Was she joking after all?
Futaba-senpai chuckled.
“—Suzuna?!”
A tense voice cut through the quiet air around Futaba-senpai.
Riri-chan was out of breath.
“Is that the person you were talking about, Suzuna-chan?”
“Ah, yes, but…”
“Hmm, unexpected. You have a type, huh?”
What’s with that way of speaking, as if I’m choosing a romantic partner?
Futaba-senpai’s lighthearted remark seemed to displease Riri-chan.
“Hey, who are you? What are you doing with Suzuna?”
Riri-chan glared down at Futaba-senpai.
Even I, watching from the side, felt the intensity of her gaze.
“I’m Futaba Yuu. Suzuna-chan seemed troubled, so I offered her some advice. Hinase Riri-chan.”
Futaba-senpai also seemed to know Riri-chan, who is exceptionally famous within the school.
I had told Riri-chan about Futaba-senpai, so she recognized her immediately.
But I don’t understand why her brow furrowed even deeper…
“I see. But Suzuna is with me, so give her back.”
Riri-chan grabbed my arm.
“That’s why Suzuna-chan is hurting, you know? Treating her like she’s your possession.”
Riri-chan’s demeanor became even more tense.
“You don’t know anything about Suzuna or me, so don’t act all high and mighty.”
“Hmm, so it’s okay to make her suffer if you do know a lot about her?”
“I didn’t say that.”
“That’s how it sounds. And Suzuna-chan seemed to be having a hard time being swayed by your words.”
“That’s…”
Riri-chan’s voice trailed off, which was unusual for her.
“Well, if you want to treat her like an object, then you have to truly cherish her, you know? You can’t be flirting with other girls—”
Futaba-senpai stood up, her tone still ambiguous, a mix of seriousness and jest.
She placed her hand on Riri-chan’s shoulder.
“—Otherwise, someone else might take her away.”
“—!!”
She whispered the last part into Riri-chan’s ear, so I couldn’t hear it.
But Riri-chan’s expression hardened, so I knew it wasn’t anything good.
“Well, you two should get along. See you later, Suzuna-chan.”
Futaba-senpai waved and left the park.
…She’s truly an enigma.
“She’s annoying. I don’t like her type.”
Riri-chan was indignant.
It’s true that they don’t seem very compatible.
Or rather, Futaba-senpai probably doesn’t care.
“…Is that so?”
I couldn’t shake off Riri-chan’s grip on my arm and didn’t know what to do.
The animosity I felt earlier had somehow faded.
“Suzuna, I’m sorry. I really didn’t mean it like that. Kaede’s present was a last-minute thought. I should have told you.”
“…Ah, okay.”
I’m not an afterthought.
I’m not just an extra, that’s what Riri-chan is saying.
I couldn’t process it earlier, my emotions were all over the place.
But now, I could calmly accept those words.
“I think I was just… upset that I felt left out. …But I shouldn’t have acted like that. I’m sorry, I was being stupid.”
I’m probably more foolish than anyone, being swayed by emotions I don’t even understand.
I felt guilty for dragging Riri-chan into this mess.
“I won’t leave you behind, Suzuna, so don’t worry.”
“…Okay.”
I should trust Riri-chan more.
I’m weak-willed, easily swayed by my emotions.
But I should cherish Riri-chan, who stays by my side.
I held her hand tightly and stood up.
“I can’t leave you alone, Suzuna. You always get caught up with someone else.”
“Don’t talk about me like I’m a child.”
The dress fluttered around me, and this time, it felt… light.
------------------ 
51 It Seems to Be My Turn
“…Hmm.”
The sound of my phone alarm.
I set it so I wouldn’t be late for my plans with Riri-chan.
I forgot to turn it off.
Bright sunlight streamed through the curtains.
A typical lazy Sunday morning.
I didn’t feel like moving, so I stayed curled up in bed.
There’s no reason to get up since it’s a holiday.
If I don’t have to move, I’m a lazy person who avoids movement as much as possible.
“…Sigh…”
Along with waking up, I remembered yesterday’s events.
I acted strangely just from hearing Tachibana-san’s name from Riri-chan.
Riri-chan forgave me, but lately, I think I’m losing it.
I thought I was more selfish, able to maintain a calm demeanor.
But lately, when it comes to Riri-chan, my heart races, and I act impulsively.
I’m being controlled by my emotions rather than my logic.
I wonder why.
Is it because Shindo-kun and the heroines’ relationships aren’t going anywhere?
If this continues, a bad future awaits me.
Is that anxiety causing me to act strangely around Riri-chan?
No, but that would be taking it out on her…
I’m anxious, but I don’t think I’m so troubled that I’d take it out on Riri-chan.
“…I don’t know.”
I still couldn’t find the answer.
I didn’t feel like doing anything after I got home yesterday.
So I just went to bed, and my hair is a mess.
I thought about going back to sleep, but once I noticed it, I couldn’t sleep comfortably.
“…Can’t be helped, I guess I’ll get up.”
I gave up and got out of bed.
I left my room and went down the stairs to the first floor.
No one was in the living room.
Amatsuki Suzuna lives alone in this house.
Apparently, her parents are away on business.
Living alone at this impressionable age seems appealing, but it’s a pain to have to do all the housework yourself.
I’m sure Amatsuki Suzuna’s domestic skills improved thanks to this environment, but it doesn’t suit a lazy person like me.
I went to the changing room and took off my pajamas and underwear.
I took a shower.
“…I’m tired.”
After getting out, I dried myself with a bath towel and roughly dried my hair.
Amatsuki Suzuna’s hair isn’t that long, so it doesn’t take long to dry.
I returned to my room and sat down in a floor chair.
—Ping
A message notification sound from my phone.
It’s rare for my phone to make that sound.
Sadly, I don’t have any contacts besides Shindo Minato, Hinase Riri, and my parents.
I reached for my phone and checked the message.
“Suzuna, are you home?”
…It was from Riri-chan.
It was surprising to receive a message from her so soon after yesterday.
But the content of the message was unclear.
“I am.”
I read it immediately.
“Can you… see outside?”
Hmm…?
Still unclear.
Does she want me to look outside?
I opened the curtains, which had been closed, and looked outside.
“Eh…”
There was a girl standing on the street outside my house, waving both hands. She was wearing a cap, a hoodie, and denim shorts.
Or rather, it was Riri-chan.
Wait, why is she here?
“…”
While I was frozen, Riri-chan froze too.
No, you don’t have to freeze.
—Ping
My phone beeped again.
“Suzuna, you’re too sexy?!”
…Ah.
I’m still in a towel.
◇◇◇
“Wh-What’s the meaning of this?! Appearing like that… are you an exhibitionist, Suzuna?!”
That was the first thing Riri-chan said after I hurriedly dried my hair, changed into my loungewear, and let her in.
And she was breathing heavily.
I should be the one breathing heavily after rushing to get ready.
“Of course not! You told me to look outside right after I took a shower.”
“S-Seriously…?”
“It’s impossible for me to plan that.”
“Th-That’s true… Lucky.”
Riri-chan is still being cryptic.
“And why are you so calm, Suzuna? You were pretty sexy.”
“Well, even if you saw my body… it’s… worthless. I should be the one apologizing.”
Not that I wanted to show her, but it was from a distance.
Or rather, I should be the one apologizing for showing her my skinny body.
If anyone’s sexy, it’s Riri-chan… no, that’s not right.
My thoughts are going in a strange direction.
Calm down, me.
“…Should we go inside?”
Talking about me being in a towel at the entrance is the biggest waste of time.
“Is that okay?”
“No, that’s what you were planning all along, wasn’t it?”
“I was thinking it would be fine just to see your face, Suzuna.”
“…Oh.”
Riri-chan suddenly says the most unexpected things.
I don’t know how to react, so I wish she wouldn’t.
“But I’ll go inside if it’s okay. Excuse me.”
Riri-chan took off her white canvas low-cut sneakers and entered the house.
“Hmm? What’s wrong?”
Riri-chan tilted her head, noticing my gaze.
“Well, you seem different from yesterday.”
“Ah, ahaha, I’m usually like this. Yesterday was special.”
“…I see.”
Yesterday’s shopping trip ended awkwardly because I felt negative emotions towards Tachibana-san.
I’m really losing it.
I composed myself and led Riri-chan to the living room.
“Are your parents not home?”
“No, they’re both often away on business trips.”
Or rather, since I’m Yukitsuki Mashiro, they’re strangers to me.
“Eh, what? Same here.”
“…That’s true.”
It’s true that among the heroines, only Amatsuki Suzuna and Hinase Riri live apart from their parents.
“Hmm, hmm… that might be convenient.”
“What is?”
“Ah, nothing, it’s my own business.”
Riri-chan waved her hand dismissively.
“By the way, how do you know where I live, Riri-chan?”
She’s been near my house before, but she’s never come directly.
This is the first time.
“Eh…? I wouldn’t… secretly follow you home after school one day, would I?”
She had a mischievous look on her face.
Well, it’s fine since it’s Riri-chan.
“You could have just asked me directly.”
“Would you have told me if I did?”
“…Of course.”
I know where Riri-chan lives, so there’s no way I wouldn’t tell her.
“What if someone other than me asked for your address?”
“…I wouldn’t tell them.”
I’m not stupid enough to leak information like that.
“Fufufu, that’s good to know.”
But Riri-chan seemed pleased.
“So, what did you come all this way for, Riri-chan?”
“Ah, well. It’s already May, so we have midterms coming up, right? I really need to study, don’t I?”
Riri-chan showed me her backpack.
It probably contains textbooks and such.
“Okay, but you’re surprisingly studious, Riri-chan.”
I thought this before, but I didn’t think Hinase Riri was the type to study hard.
“It’s a perfect excuse, isn’t it?”
“…For what?”
“You wouldn’t understand, would you? That’s the kind of person you are.”
Riri-chan seemed unilaterally convinced and didn’t explain further.
Well… it’s not a big deal.
“Then I’ll go get my textbooks and stuff, so wait here.”
I have to go back to my room on the second floor to get my study materials.
“No, no, Suzuna, wait a minute.”
She stopped me dramatically.
“When you study with a friend, it’s always in their room, right?”
That’s the first time I’ve heard of that rule.
“My room is small, and the table is small. It’s much easier to study in the living room.”
I pointed at the dining table in the living room.
“No, stop prioritizing functionality! That’s a bad habit of yours, Suzuna.”
I don’t think anyone has ever told me that prioritizing functionality is a bad habit.
Anyway, Riri-chan seems to want to study in my room.
“…Well, okay.”
I don’t have a reason to refuse.
“Yay!”
“But it’s not very tidy.”
“That’s even better.”
…Riri-chan has been saying strange things ever since she arrived.
◇◇◇
I led her to my room.
“Here it is.”
I opened the door and invited Riri-chan into my room.
It felt a little strange.
“It smells like you, Suzuna.”
“…”
There’s a pervert here.
52 Facing Your Feelings
“Hmm… so this is Suzuna’s room.”
Riri-chan looked around my room curiously.
I wonder if I reacted the same way when I entered her room.
It feels a little embarrassing to have someone look at my room, like they’re peeking into my mind.
“It’s not that unusual, is it?”
“No, but it’s… heartwarming to think that you live here, Suzuna.”
She’s saying something strange.
Amatsuki Suzuna’s room lacks any sense of unity. A wooden bed, an ordinary study desk, a white low table, and a navy blue floor chair take up most of the space.
It’s not particularly stylish or personalized.
It’s not especially girly either; you could call it characterless.
“Riri-chan, sit there.”
I pointed at the floor chair in the center of the room.
“Is that okay?”
“It is.”
I can’t just have my guest sit on the floor, can I?
“What about you, Suzuna?”
“I’ll sit on a cushion.”
“I feel bad…”
Despite saying that, Riri-chan readily sat down in my floor chair.
It felt strange to see Riri-chan sitting in my usual spot.
“So this is the shape of Suzuna’s butt…”
She muttered something incomprehensible again.
Anyway, since Riri-chan said she came to study, let’s focus on that.
I have a history of acting strangely at Riri-chan’s house.
So I told myself to exercise self-control today.
It’s okay, Riri-chan isn’t wearing anything revealing today, so I should be safe.
◇◇◇
“Did you know? Apparently, Uemura and Endo are dating.”
Riri-chan suddenly started gossiping.
Why is she saying this, interrupting our study session?
Uemura-kun and Endo-san are classmates, a boy and a girl.
“…Is that so?”
I’m not a big fan of studying, so I wouldn’t say “Focus on studying.”
But I could only offer a minimal response to her sudden love talk.
“Isn’t that surprising? They have quite different personalities.”
“It is…”
Honestly, I don’t know them very well.
The only people I know are Riri-chan, Shindo-kun, and the other heroines.
I don’t really interact with other people, so I don’t have any information about them.
I probably wouldn’t have known if Riri-chan hadn’t told me.
“That’s a weak reaction. It’s a hot topic in class.”
“I don’t really know them.”
I’m not interested in celebrity gossip.
I tend to have an indifferent reaction to the love lives of people I don’t know.
I envy Riri-chan, who’s interested in everything.
“Hmm. You’re not interested in love talk, Suzuna?”
“Not really.”
They say a maiden in love is like a blooming flower, but if I walked past, the flowers would probably wilt.
I’m that kind of dry person.
“Then you’re not interested in my love life either?”
I realized that those words instantly changed my indifferent mood.
Riri-chan’s words easily sway my emotions.
“…I’m interested in yours, Riri-chan.”
“Oh? You’re interested in me?”
Riri-chan grinned mischievously.
She’s probably trying to get me to say something, but I can’t let my guard down because she’s a pervert.
“Of course I’m more interested in my friend than in strangers.”
“Maybe, but would you… listen to my relationship problems?”
“…Um…”
That would mean listening to her talk about the person she likes.
But imagining that made me feel… uneasy.
“Well?”
“…No.”
I don’t think I can be happy knowing that.
I felt strangely reluctant.
“Eh, that’s different from what you just said.”
“I can’t offer any advice to Miss Popular. I wouldn’t be a good listener.”
“Just listening is enough.”
“I’ll pass.”
“Then what about you, Suzuna?”
“Eh…”
Now Riri-chan was staring intently at me.
Her gaze seemed to say, “I told you mine, now it’s your turn.”
“Won’t you tell me about your love life, Suzuna?”
“…Of course not.”
“Eh, why? You can tell me.”
Because love talk presupposes that you have someone you like.
I don’t have anyone like that—
“It’s embarrassing.”
—I couldn’t say “I don’t,” and my voice trailed off.
“Suzuna, you’re such a shy person. Well, that’s what’s cute about you.”
“Don’t say such weird things.”
But I wonder what Riri-chan’s current love life is like.
Thinking about it won’t give me the answer.
“…Riri-chan, are you… in love?”
She said she has someone she likes, but what’s their relationship like?
“Aren’t we supposed to be talking about love?”
“I’m just asking.”
“Hmm? Fufu… I wonder?”
Riri-chan grinned, her most mischievous expression yet.
She seems to be enjoying my reaction.
“I’m the one asking, you know.”
“I’ll tell you if you tell me.”
…That’s not possible.
I can’t put into words emotions I don’t even understand myself.
“Just kidding. I know you’re shy, Suzuna, so let’s talk about love after you graduate from being shy.”
“…What’s that supposed to mean?”
Riri-chan sometimes plays with me like this.
This is one of those times.
“Ehehe. It would be fun to talk about that kind of stuff with you, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan smiled gently and stood up from the floor chair.
“What’s wrong?”
“Can I use the restroom?”
“Ah, it’s—”
I told her it was on the first floor, near the changing room.
“Thanks.”
Riri-chan left the room.
I heard her footsteps as she went down the stairs.
“…Someone she likes, huh?”
Well, I’m one thing, but the person Riri-chan likes…
I wonder who it is.
If that person knew, they’d probably confess to Riri-chan immediately.
She’s that charming.
But if Riri-chan gets a boyfriend, what will happen to our time together?
It’ll definitely decrease, won’t it?
That makes me feel very lonely.
I hoped the day we talk about love would never come.
------------------ 
53 Nothing but Worries: Hinase Riri’s Side
“Ah, I didn’t offer you anything to drink.”
Suzuna looked up as if startled when we resumed studying.
“Oh, don’t worry about it.”
“It’s no trouble at all. You want something to drink, right?”
“Is that okay?”
“Well, all I have is instant tea or coffee…”
Oh… Suzuna is preparing a drink for me.
What a rare sight.
This alone makes it worth braving the trip to Suzuna’s house.
“Then tea, please.”
“Okay.”
Suzuna went downstairs.
A short while later, she returned, holding two mugs in her hands.
A simple black and white design.
Unpretentious, but very Suzuna-like.
“Here you go.”
“Thanks.”
She placed the mugs on the empty space on the table.
Tea made by Suzuna… this is a precious treasure.
“What’s wrong?”
Suzuna asked, probably finding my reaction strange.
“No, it’s just… I’m touched that you made it for me, Suzuna.”
“It’s just instant tea.”
Suzuna frowned.
“That’s not the point. …Thank you.”
I took a sip of the tea.
A gentle sweetness and a hint of bitterness spread through my mouth.
When I put down the mug, Suzuna continued to stare at me.
“What? You’re making me blush.”
“I was just thinking it probably doesn’t taste that good since it’s not… authentic like yours, Riri-chan.”
I tried to be playful, but she replied in a serious tone.
She was worried about that?
“No, it’s delicious.”
“That’s not true, it’s instant tea.”
Tut, tut, tut.
Suzuna doesn’t understand…
Taste isn’t determined by the ingredients alone.
“It’s delicious because you made it, Suzuna.”
Suzuna, the queen of laziness, made tea for me.
That alone makes it taste better than anything I could get at a cafe.
“…Oh.”
But Suzuna’s reply was curt.
She looked down at her textbook and resumed studying.
I thought I said something nice, but did it not resonate with her?
Suzuna’s feelings are difficult to understand.
◇◇◇
Evening arrived quickly.
As the room gradually darkened, I had a thought.
“…Aren’t you hungry?”
If Suzuna lived with her parents, I would have suggested going home around this time.
But Suzuna lives alone.
I wondered… if she’d like to have dinner together…
“I might be.”
Suzuna looked up and replied readily.
“What do you usually do for dinner?”
“I live alone, so I just eat whatever.”
“…Whatever?”
I’m curious about what that entails.
“Instant ramen, convenience store bentos, and stuff like that.”
That was the answer I was most worried about.
“Do you ever cook?”
“I can manage the process up to pouring hot water.”
“That’s just instant ramen.”
“That’s one way to put it.”
And that’s all she said.
“Eh, won’t you be malnourished if you only eat that?”
“Malnourished…?”
Why is that a question?
“Okay, I’ll make you dinner.”
“Eh, that’s too much trouble. You’re always giving me your bento. I’d feel bad if you did more for me.”
“No, I’m more worried about your health, Suzuna. Eating like that at your age… it’s definitely not good, especially for your beauty.”
Maybe the reason Suzuna is so thin is because she’s not getting proper nutrition.
“If you do that much, you’ll become my mom.”
Those words resonated with me.
“…Being Suzuna’s mom… doesn’t sound so bad.”
“No, it’s bad.”
Suzuna looked exasperated.
I feel like I lose my mind a little when it comes to Suzuna.
“Well, that aside, I’m seriously making dinner, okay?”
“Ehhh… are you sure?”
“I am. Do you have any ingredients?”
I’ll probably have to go shopping, but I want to know what she has.
“…Do I… have any…?”
“…Well, I thought you might have something.”
“You can check.”
The refrigerator was almost empty.
The cupboard, on the other hand, was overflowing with instant ramen.
“It really is all instant ramen.”
“I told you, didn’t I?”
There’s no need to look so smug.
“…Yeah, yeah, I know. So, do you have anything you want to eat?”
“Since you’re making it, Riri-chan, anything you want is fine.”
“No, I’m making it for you, Suzuna, so I’ll make whatever you want.”
“Ehhh…”
Suzuna groaned and thought about it.
She’s been saying “Ehhh” a lot since we started talking about dinner.
“Pasta, I guess?”
“Ehhh…”
Now it was my turn to say “Ehhh.”
Anyone can make pasta, as long as you don’t aim for restaurant quality…
“Eh, is that not okay?”
“No, it’s fine, but… I thought it would be… more substantial than just noodles…”
I wonder if Suzuna likes noodles.
“Noodles are delicious.”
“Well, yeah, but…”
Suzuna seems to be quite indifferent to food.
She doesn’t seem to care about health or beauty through diet.
I’m worried, I’m worried about Suzuna in many ways.
“But I understand. I’ll make it if that’s what you want, Suzuna.”
“…If it’s too much trouble, I have instant pasta.”
Please, don’t joke about that.
“No, I’ll make it.”
I decided to quickly go to the nearby supermarket to buy ingredients.
◇◇◇
“…Do you need any help?”
When I returned home after shopping and started cooking in the kitchen, Suzuna wandered over.
“Ah, then can you shred this cabbage?”
A salad is essential; she’ll definitely be malnourished if she only eats pasta.
I handed Suzuna half a head of cabbage.
“Leave it to me.”
…I glanced at Suzuna’s hands.
“Alright.”
—Swish
Suzuna raised the knife, aiming for the cabbage.
“Um, Suzuna, maybe you shouldn’t.”
“Eh, why?”
I know from the volleyball incident that Suzuna is incredibly clumsy.
This is probably the same.
Because I couldn’t stop shivering.
Her fingers holding the cabbage were straight.
She’s going to cut her fingers off like that.
“Suzuna, have you ever used a knife before?”
“I think so?”
…I remembered. The bento Suzuna made for Shindo Kokona looked disastrous.
I definitely shouldn’t let her do this.
“I’m boiling the pasta, so can you stir that?”
“Okay.”
That was close…
◇◇◇
I made meat sauce pasta, a cabbage, lettuce, and cucumber salad, rolled cabbage, and vegetable soup.
Yeah, this should cover all the nutritional bases.
“Wow, amazing…”
Suzuna gasped, looking at the dishes on the table.
I’m a little happy.
“Bon appétit.”
“Thanks, let’s eat.”
Suzuna twirled the pasta with a fork and spoon.
The pasta smoothly entered her mouth.
She also ate the salad, rolled cabbage, and vegetable soup.
“…Riri-chan.”
Suzuna placed her fork and spoon on the table and spoke in a formal tone.
“You’ll make a good wife.”
“What do you mean?”
“It’s delicious.”
Ah, that’s what she meant.
Hearing that, I breathed a sigh of relief.
“I’m glad you like it.”
“Anyone who doesn’t like this has a terrible palate.”
“Ahaha, that’s good to hear.”
I’m happy that Suzuna likes it.
The thought of Suzuna eating what I made, it becoming a part of her, made me feel a little excited.
Am I really a pervert?
“What are you going to do?”
“Um, what do you mean?”
Suzuna looked at me with a slightly accusatory look.
Do people usually give you that look after saying it’s delicious?
“I can’t eat instant ramen anymore after this.”
It was a complaint disguised as the highest praise.
54 It Can’t Be Helped
“Hey, Suzuna, help me study.”
It’s May, and the midterms are a week away.
Perhaps because this is a preparatory school, the atmosphere in the class is gradually becoming clouded with pre-test anxiety.
Shindo Minato, sitting at the desk in front of me, suddenly said that.
“No way.”
“Cold!”
Actually, this triggers a choice-based event.
If you choose the childhood friend, Amatsuki Suzuna, it’s a relaxed study session.
If you choose the gal, Hinase Riri, it’s lively and fun.
If you choose the student council president, Kanaori Reika, it’s strict but with occasional moments of kindness.
If you choose the senpai, Futaba Yuu, you benefit from her mature guidance.
If you choose the younger sister, Shindo Kokona, it’s filled with doting affection.
*Kokona-chan has already studied the second-year curriculum in advance to tutor her brother. A love fueled by dedication.
Each heroine tutors Shindo-kun in her own unique style.
So it’s fine; even if I don’t teach him, there are others who will.
“Isn’t there anyone else who can help you?”
I checked if Shindo-kun had any other heroine candidates in mind.
“I asked Kokona, and she just brushed me off, saying, ‘Study by yourself.’”
He replied, winking.
So he skipped the Kokona-chan event too.
“Well, she’s right. And that wink was creepy, so don’t do it again.”
“It’s a wink!”
“Apologize to the wink.”
“Who am I supposed to apologize to?!”
“Humanity.”
“Isn’t that a bit broad?!”
Seriously…
I just want some peace and quiet.
Why is he so energetic and argumentative in the morning?
“Isn’t there anyone else who can help you?”
“Eh… not really.”
Since he asked his little sister before asking his childhood friend, he probably doesn’t have many options.
Shindo-kun has a bright personality, but he doesn’t have any close friends.
Without the heroines, he’s often alone.
He’s not exactly a loner, so he doesn’t stand out much, but still.
“That’s a problem.”
That means he won’t trigger any flags with the other heroines.
At this rate, the only ending left is the bad ending where only the childhood friend, Amatsuki Suzuna, remains.
“That’s why everything would be solved if you just let Suzuna teach you.”
But that would increase my affection value with him, so it’s no good.
“How about failing and repeating the year?”
“Are you a demon? Why are you saying such ridiculous things with such excitement?”
I wonder if there’s a way to trigger an ending that’s not in the original story by making him do something unprecedented.
…Well, relying on that is too much of a gamble.
Then I have no choice but to trigger flags with the other heroines myself.
I’ll increase his options, like a true harem protagonist.
“Okay, let’s have a study session after school today.”
“Eh, seriously? You’ll teach me?”
“Yeah, but can I invite other people?”
“Sure, but will they be helpful?”
Why is he talking down to me when he’s the one asking for help?
“They’re much more capable than I am.”
“Okay, then it’s fine!”
Perhaps because I told him not to wink, he gave me a thumbs-up with a grin, showing his white teeth.
That’s also irritating.
“Don’t point at people.”
“It’s a thumbs-up!”
◇◇◇
During lunch break, after finishing lunch with Riri-chan, I went out into the hallway.
First, I needed to secure a place to study.
—Knock, knock
“Come in.”
I knocked on the door, and a clear voice responded.
“Excuse me.”
“Oh, it’s Amatsuki-san. What is it?”
I visited the student council room.
Kanaori Reika was sitting at her sturdy desk.
There was a stack of papers on her desk, suggesting she was busy.
“Sorry to interrupt your work, is this a bad time?”
“It’s fine. Listening to students’ concerns is also part of the student council’s duties, so there’s no need to worry.”
Such a textbook-perfect response.
With the sunlight streaming in from the window behind her, she looked divine…
“Um, the midterms are coming up soon, aren’t they? I was wondering… if you could help me study…”
“Certainly.”
Kanaori-san readily agreed.
“Really? I thought you’d be busy with student council work…”
“I would never turn away a student who wants to study.”
A goddess…
She’s such a good person.
“Then, could I use this room after school…?”
Kanaori-san thought for a moment.
“I don’t have any student council work today, and the other officers are also absent, so it should be fine.”
“And there are other students who are struggling with their studies, so is it okay if I bring them along?”
“Oh, it’s not just you, Amatsuki-san…?”
Kanaori-san muttered, sounding slightly surprised, and then—
“That’s fine. I’ll be happy to help if I can.”
These are the words of the top student in our year.
If you can’t help, then no one can.
“Thank you very much.”
I bowed and left the student council room.
◇◇◇
Next, I went to the first floor.
I cautiously peeked into the first-year classrooms.
“There she is…”
Luckily, I spotted Shindo Kokona-chan in her classroom.
But…
It’s hard to enter the world of unfamiliar underclassmen, so I stood by the door, hoping she would notice me.
Then another girl tapped Kokona-chan on the shoulder and pointed at me.
Kokona-chan’s mouth dropped open in surprise, and she immediately came over.
“Ah, Amatsuki Suzuna… what are you doing in front of the first-year classrooms?”
“I have something to ask you, Kokona-chan.”
“Then you should have just called out to me. The other girls told me, ‘There’s a creepy senpai staring at Kokona.’”
“Oh, I see…”
So I stood out in a bad way.
“So, what do you want?”
“Um, I was thinking, how about a study session after school?”
“…Why would you invite Kokona? I’m a year younger than you.”
“I know that you’ve already covered the second-year curriculum, Kokona-chan.”
“H-How do you know that?!”
Because I’ve played the game.
“Shindo-kun asked me to help him study, so let’s do it together.”
“Eh, Onii-chan will be there too…? I thought it would be better for him to study by himself, so I left him alone.”
“I understand, but wouldn’t it be okay to study together as a group? It won’t be one-sided.”
“…Maybe.”
“Yeah, then after school, in the student council room.”
I managed to make plans with her.
Since it’s conspicuous for an upperclassman to be in a lowerclassman’s classroom, I left immediately.
“…The student council room?”
Kokona-chan said something, but it was drowned out by the noise in the hallway.
◇◇◇
“…Th-This is tiring.”
Next, I went to the rooftop.
Going back and forth like this was exhausting.
I finally made it and opened the door, letting in the outside air.
There, gazing up at the clear blue sky, was the back of a girl.
“Futaba-senpai.”
“Oh, it’s Suzuna-chan. What’s up?”
Futaba-senpai, as relaxed as ever, responded casually.
“Let’s study together after school.”
“Whoa, that’s sudden.”
“As a senpai, you’ve already covered the second-year material, right? And you’re studying for university entrance exams too, aren’t you?”
“…I am, to some extent, but I’m not sure if I’m good enough to teach anyone.”
“It’s fine, please.”
“Hmm, I can’t refuse if Suzuna-chan asks.”
Futaba-senpai readily agreed.
“Then after school, in the student council room. There will be a classmate and a kouhai there too.”
“Eh, it’s like that…?”
Relieved, I left the rooftop.
◇◇◇
I returned to the classroom and was about to walk to my seat when—
“Ah, Suzuna? Are you free after school today?”
I stopped dead in my tracks.
Riri-chan was next to me.
“If you are, could you help me study again?”
“…Um, well…”
How do I explain this situation to Riri-chan…?
I could see my future being scolded, and my back started to sweat.
------------------ 
55 All to Myself
“Um, Suzuna, did you have something to do after school?”
Riri-chan tilted her head as I struggled to answer.
If I told her I was gathering Shindo-kun and the heroines… how would she react?
…She probably wouldn’t be happy.
“We’re having a study group.”
“Eh, you are, Suzuna? With who?”
Riri-chan, knowing that I don’t have any friends, asked a natural question.
“Shindo-kun, Kokona-chan, Kanaori-san, and Futaba-senpai.”
“…What’s with that group?”
I couldn’t tell her it was the protagonist and the heroines.
They seem to have nothing in common at first glance, so it would just be confusing.
“Shindo-kun asked me to help him study, but I thought I wasn’t enough on my own, so I gathered other people…”
“Hmm. And what about me?”
“I didn’t… ask you, Riri-chan…”
“Why?”
Riri-chan’s eyes narrowed, and her voice sharpened.
“Well, um, that’s…”
“You wanted to study without me?”
…It’s not like I’m trying to increase the chances of a route without Riri-chan.
“I didn’t want you to participate, if possible.”
When I told her directly, Riri-chan’s eyes widened in surprise, but her expression quickly hardened.
“Even I get hurt sometimes, you know…”
Riri-chan gritted her teeth.
I didn’t want to make her look so pained.
“I-It’s not like that, Riri-chan. There’s a reason.”
“What reason?”
“Well, um… you know…”
I can’t say the real reason out loud.
“You don’t really get along with Kanaori-san, and things are awkward with Kokona-chan and Futaba-san…”
“So you were being considerate of me?”
“Well, yeah…”
That’s not the real reason.
But I couldn’t think of any other excuse that would be somewhat convincing.
“So, you’re saying it’s okay if I participate as long as I don’t cause any trouble with the others?”
“Eh, ah, well…”
Riri-chan wouldn’t back down.
“There’s another reason, isn’t there? Tell me.”
She glared at me.
I can’t deceive Riri-chan, huh…
“…Shindo-kun will be there.”
“So?”
“You might… fall for him, Riri-chan.”
“…Huh?”
What are you talking about?
That’s what her eyes seemed to say.
“Me? Fall for Shindo?”
The reason is obvious to me.
I don’t want Hinase Riri to be the heroine who ends up with Shindo Minato.
I don’t want to see an ending where Shindo-kun and Riri-chan end up together.
That feeling has become a major part of me.
Would she believe me if I said, “This is a dating sim, and I don’t want you near him because you might fall for him”?
“He is a boy, after all.”
“…No, that’s not going to happen.”
That’s not true.
Riri-chan can say that because she doesn’t realize she’s a heroine.
“There’s always a possibility.”
“That’s because you used to like Shindo, isn’t it, Suzuna?”
“…Why would you think that?”
“Since you liked him that much, you probably still think he’s a good catch.”
She doesn’t understand.
Because of my irregular existence, Yukitsuki Mashiro, in this dating sim, my feelings don’t reach her.
It was Amatsuki Suzuna who liked Shindo Minato, not me, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
“That’s not true.”
“Okay, let’s say, hypothetically, that you’re worried about that. But that means you’re not really thinking about me, are you?”
Riri-chan moved closer.
Her tone was softer than before, but there was still a hint of reproach in her voice.
“Is that so?”
“Yeah. I don’t think you should gather everyone just to teach him.”
What does that mean…?
“Are you saying I should always be alone?”
“I’m here.”
“Only you, Riri-chan?”
“Isn’t that enough?”
Is she enjoying looking down on me, the loner?
“…Are you trying to bully me?”
“No, I’m just saying it’s fine if you’re only with me.”
She’s saying strange things again.
What does Riri-chan want to do, leaving me alone like this?
“So I’m going to stop you from being with other people, Suzuna. No objections.”
“Eh…”
In the end, I was forced to give in.
◇◇◇
So, after school, everyone gathered in the student council room.
Kokona-chan and Futaba-senpai haven’t arrived yet since they’re in different years.
“Well, well, well… This is the student council room, where we value discipline. I don’t know what you were thinking, but you have some nerve entering this room in such a disorderly state.”
Kanaori-san suddenly launched into a sarcastic tirade.
Directed at…
“I just came to study, and I have no business with you, so you can leave.”
Riri-chan, of course.
“As I said, this is the student council room. Why should I be the one to leave?”
“School is a place for students. That sounds like you’re abusing your power and treating the school as your personal property.”
“She’s only making sense now…”
Ah… this is what always happens between Kanaori-san and Riri-chan.
—Click
“Huh… Hinase Riri? Are you here to study too?”
Kokona-chan, who arrived late, sounded surprised.
“Of course I study.”
“…So, repeating a year has finally become a reality, huh?”
Kokona-chan looked at Riri-chan with pity.
“It’s not that bad!”
“It’s okay, you don’t have to hide it. You look like you’re bad at studying.”
“Don’t judge a book by its cover!”
“A gal who can’t be judged by her looks… does that even have value?”
“Are you picking a fight with me?”
Hmm… these two are also on the verge of a fight.
—Click
“Ah, you’re…”
Futaba-senpai, the last to arrive, noticed Riri-chan.
“You’re the one from the other day…”
“You’re with Suzuna-chan again. Did you really take my words seriously and become this possessive?”
“I don’t remember anything you said.”
Riri-chan, you made a similar remark to me earlier…
You don’t remember…?
I really don’t understand what she’s thinking.
56 Study Session
“Shall we begin…?”
Since everyone had gathered, it was naturally time to study.
However, currently, everyone except Kanaori-san was standing.
At the back of the room was Kanaori-san’s desk, and in front of it was a long table.
The student council officers probably work here regularly.
Naturally, we’d be sitting at this table to study, but…
“Please, sit wherever you like.”
Kanaori-san graciously gave us permission.
“Everyone…”
But even as I looked around, no one seemed inclined to move.
Why…?
“You should sit down first, Amatsuki Suzuna.”
Kokona-chan urged me.
It seemed like I, the one who proposed the study session, had to take the initiative.
“Okay, then I’ll sit down.”
I decided to sit on the right side at the far end of the table, as seen from the entrance.
“Then I’ll sit next to Suzuna…”
Just as Riri-chan started walking—
“Kokona will sit next to Amatsuki Suzuna.”
Kokona-chan spoke up.
“Huh? What are you talking about?”
“Kokona’s the only underclassman, right? I’ll be lonely surrounded by senpais, so isn’t it natural for me to sit next to Amatsuki Suzuna, who I know?”
She said that to Riri-chan, her senpai, without a hint of hesitation.
“You can say ‘lonely’ with such confidence?”
“Ah, senpai is scary~”
Kokona-chan pretended to cower and tremble.
“And if you know someone, you have your brother, don’t you?”
“Onii-chan wants to become more independent from his little sister, so it’s fine.”
“?!”
Shindo-kun’s eyes widened in surprise at Kokona-chan’s words.
He seems to have no such intention.
“Independent little sister” is probably more accurate.
“Then, as the only third-year, I feel a little uneasy, so I think I’ll sit next to Suzuna-chan.”
Futaba-senpai unexpectedly joined the fray.
“You’re an upperclassman, so you should be able to communicate just fine.”
And, naturally, Riri-chan tried to stop Futaba-senpai as well.
“Everyone gets lonely when they’re alone.”
“Says the girl who’s always alone on the rooftop.”
And as expected, the three of them stared each other down.
…Should I just leave?
“I understand. Since this is going nowhere, I will sit next to Amatsuki-san.”
Finally, even Kanaori-san stood up from her desk and approached the table.
“You should stay in your fancy seat over there!”
“Wouldn’t it be inefficient to teach from a distance?”
In the end, no one was willing to compromise.
Why is this happening?
“Then why don’t we draw lots?”
Shindo-kun, seeing the stalemate, offered a suggestion.
“We won’t decide otherwise.”
‘…’
Everyone fell silent, but no one objected.
◇◇◇
The final seating arrangement, as seen from the entrance, was like this:
Kokona-chan, me, Futaba-senpai
Riri-chan, Kanaori-san, Shindo-kun
“Why does this always happen to me…?”
Riri-chan grumbled.
She ended up diagonally across from me on the right.
“That’s my line. Why do I have to be with you…?”
Kanaori-san, next to Riri-chan, also grumbled.
“I can’t get Suzuna to teach me from this seat.”
“Study by yourself.”
Kanaori-san retorted bluntly to Riri-chan, who was pouting.
“Then what’s the point of this study session?”
“Studying is basically a solitary activity. The purpose of this kind of gathering is to create an environment where you can’t escape from studying.”
“But you being next to me is making me lose motivation! This is a terrible environment!”
“You…”
As usual, they were saying whatever they wanted.
“Amatsuki Suzuna, I’ll help you if there’s anything you don’t understand.”
Kokona-chan, sitting next to me on the right, offered kindly.
“Kokona-chan, do you really understand the second-year material?”
“For the most part.”
“Your grades must be good.”
“I’m second in my year.”
Kokona-chan is smart…
Shindo-kun must have a hard time, having a younger sister who’s smarter than him.
…Wait, where’s Shindo-kun?
I looked diagonally to the left.
“…”
Shindo-kun was there, silent and looking uncomfortable.
This study session was supposed to be for him, but it’s a problem if he’s just being quiet.
I have to do something to help…
“Futaba-senpai, may I ask you a favor?”
“What is it, Suzuna-chan?”
“That boy over there… Shindo-kun isn’t very good at studying, so could you help him?”
Shindo-kun shifted in his seat.
This was an unexpected development, it seems.
“Is that so?”
Futaba-senpai looked at Shindo-kun.
“Uh, well… I’m not very good at it.”
Shindo-kun replied, looking away and mumbling.
I know I’m not one to talk, but this isn’t the time to be shy, Shindo-kun!
“Is there anything you want help with?”
Even so, the kind Futaba-senpai continued to ask Shindo-kun questions.
“I want to know what kind of person you like, senpai.”
Shindo-kun…
Your timing is way off…
“U-Um… it’s a secret.”
Futaba-senpai seemed taken aback.
“Shindo-san, what kind of question is that to ask in the student council room?”
Kanaori-san sounded slightly angry.
“Sigh… Onii-chan, I’ve been telling you, girls really hate that kind of thing.”
Kokona-chan sighed.
Their intimacy levels with him aren’t rising at all…
—Ping
“…?”
My phone suddenly beeped.
“Is there any point in this study session?”
It was a message from Shindo-kun.
“Give me back my effort.”
That was my honest feeling.
◇◇◇
Since I organized this study session, I have to study hard.
I was diligently writing with my mechanical pencil when I encountered a problem I didn’t understand.
I needed to ask someone.
But who?
It’s not a difficult problem, just something I forgot, so anyone could probably answer it…
But I hesitated to ask.
“Suzuna, what’s wrong?”
But the first one to notice my hesitation was Riri-chan.
“Ah, well… I don’t understand this part…”
I pointed to the part I didn’t understand in the textbook.
“You can use this formula—”
“If you use this formula—”
“Apply this formula—”
Three voices overlapped at once.
“Hey, I was the one she asked!”
Riri-chan looked indignant.
“Because Amatsuki Suzuna looked troubled.”
“Because it seemed like Amatsuki-san didn’t understand.”
“I wanted to explain it to Suzuna-chan.”
Kokona-chan, Kanaori-san, and Futaba-senpai spoke in unison again.
What’s with this overprotective study environment…?
If they directed even a fraction of this tutoring towards Shindo-kun, the story would move forward.
But the person in question—
“…Zzz…”
He was nodding off, looking sleepy.
Th-This is hopeless…
------------------ 
57 Putting Feelings Into Words
The study session ended inconclusively.
I did get some studying done, being surrounded by smart people, but the main objective—advancing the story between Shindo-kun and the heroines—didn’t progress.
I walked home with Riri-chan, feeling unproductive.
“Hey, Suzuna. I think today’s study session was a bit… awkward.”
“…Sorry.”
Riri-chan had Kanaori Reika, whom she doesn’t get along with, sitting next to her.
Kokona-chan was in front of her, and I was diagonally across, so it must have been uncomfortable for her.
I felt bad since she wanted to study with me.
“If you’re sorry, then let’s continue.”
“Continue?”
Does she mean continue studying?
“But it’s already pretty dark, isn’t it?”
It was past six o’clock, and the sun was starting to set.
“We both live alone, so it’s not a problem, right?”
“Well… that’s true.”
And it wasn’t a bad suggestion, since I could spend more time with Riri-chan.
“Where are we going to study?”
“We can go to my house.”
“Your house…”
I’ve only been to Riri-chan’s house once.
That one time was so intense that I could feel my face heating up.
“Suzuna, are you thinking of something naughty?”
Riri-chan grinned.
It was as if she read my mind, and my voice involuntarily went up an octave.
“O-Of course not!”
“I see. So, is it okay?”
Riri-chan grabbed my wrist.
I didn’t have any particular reason to resist.
“Yeah, it’s fine.”
“Great, then it’s settled.”
As always, Riri-chan walked ahead of me.
◇◇◇
The second time in Riri-chan’s room.
It was exactly the same as before, of course.
A flashy room with black, white, and pink everywhere.
“Make yourself at home, Suzuna. Pretend it’s your room.”
“Ah, okay…”
I wasn’t just being influenced by her words, but I felt much more comfortable.
Maybe it’s because I’ve been here once before, or maybe it’s because I’ve opened up to Riri-chan.
It’s probably both, but it didn’t feel like someone else’s room anymore.
Honestly, I was also… happy.
“This blazer is so stuffy.”
Riri-chan hung her blazer on a hanger and was left in just her blouse.
I won’t make the same mistake twice.
Last time, I sat facing the bed and accidentally saw up Riri-chan’s skirt.
So today, I sat on the carpet with the bed as my backrest.
This way, I won’t see anything even if she’s careless.
“Suzuna-san, are you… being self-conscious?”
Riri-chan was teasing me, pretending not to understand even though she knew.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Is that so…? Fufu.”
Riri-chan giggled and walked behind me.
—Creak
The bed creaked.
Riri-chan really likes sitting on the bed, it seems.
“Suzuna… is there really nothing wrong?”
“What do you mean?”
“About today.”
Her tone was a little dramatic.
Riri-chan still seems unconvinced about something.
“I can kind of tell that you don’t see Shindo Minato romantically anymore, Suzuna.”
“Ah, is that so…”
Riri-chan kept glancing at me during our study session. She must have been observing me.
“But you’re still… conscious of him, aren’t you?”
“I… wonder…”
I gave a vague answer, neither confirming nor denying.
“Yeah, definitely. You seem to be interacting with him… intentionally.”
Riri-chan’s words seemed to shift from questioning to conviction.
“It’s just your imagination.”
“If that were true, there’s no way you’d go to such lengths just because he asked you to help him study, Suzuna. Even I know that.”
She probably finds it strange that I, who avoids interacting with people, would take the initiative like that.
It’s impossible to hide that from Riri-chan, who knows me so well.
“There’s a reason, isn’t there?”
“…It’s just your imagination.”
I can’t tell her it’s because this is the world of a dating sim.
It would be a relief to tell her, but…
She’d just think I’m crazy.
I don’t want Riri-chan to think I’m strange.
“So you’re not going to tell me.”
“Because there’s no reason! I just helped him because he asked. And it would be weird to study alone with Shindo-kun.”
“But that group was also weird.”
“Is that so?”
“Definitely. I can’t help but think there’s another reason, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan is sharp at times like these, so it’s hard to deceive her.
“…”
“I won’t force you to tell me if you don’t want to. But it’s also… awkward to be presented with such obvious lies.”
I didn’t know how to respond to those words and fell silent.
Will there ever be a day when I can tell her?
I’d be happy if that day came, and Riri-chan believed me.
But I don’t have the courage yet.
“What about you, Riri-chan? Why do you hate it so much when Shindo-kun and I interact? You know I don’t like him anymore, so there’s no need to be so bothered, right?”
Even Riri-chan interacts with lots of people, like Tachibana-san and her other friends.
Compared to that, I only occasionally interact with my only childhood friend.
Even if he’s a boy, I don’t think it’s something to be so concerned about, especially since she knows I don’t like him.
“…Why do you think?”
“Don’t answer my question with a question.”
“…”
Riri-chan didn’t reply.
—Creak
Instead, the bed creaked again.
At the same time, a sweet fragrance wafted through the air.
I wondered what it was, and then I felt slender arms wrap around my neck.
Riri-chan was hugging me from behind.
“R-Riri-chan…?!”
I was startled by the suddenness of it.
She’s kissed my cheek and licked my neck before, but…
She’s never embraced me so suddenly and without context.
“…You want to know why I’m so fixated on Shindo, don’t you?”
Riri-chan asked in a calm voice, ignoring my flustered state.
I feel stupid for being the only one whose heart is racing.
I’ll act calm too.
“Y-Yeah, I want to know if there’s a reason.”
“It’s because—”
Riri-chan’s warm breath tickled my ear.
“—I like you.”
She whispered.
“…Eh?”
That word completely blew away my thoughts about being hugged and her breath on my ear.
My heart leaped, making everything else insignificant.
58 Unstoppable
Eh, what did Riri-chan just say…?
Did she say “because I like you”?
I did hear that she had someone she liked…
Could it be… that—
“So, what do you think…?”
Riri-chan’s voice and breath tickled my ear.
“Wh-What do you mean…?”
“If I said I’m interfering with you and Shindo because I like you, would that be a valid reason?”
“H-Huh?!”
It is a valid reason, it is, but…
That means she seriously likes me, right?
Not as a friend, but as a… lover…
“Am I saying something strange?”
“Y-Yes, you are! Because the person you’re supposed to like, Riri-chan, is—”
Wait.
Who did Riri-chan say she likes?
From the flow of the conversation, it could be either me or Shindo-kun.
Either way, it would be a valid reason for her to interfere.
“The person I’m ‘supposed to like’… what?”
“Uh, ah, well…”
But what should I do?
Even if I confirm the answer, what then—
If she likes Shindo-kun?
If she likes me?
Could I accept either answer?
“…Fufu.”
Riri-chan giggled, oblivious to my panicked state.
Was there something funny…?
“Just kidding. Did I surprise you?”
“…Just kidding?”
“Yeah, it was a hypothetical. I was wondering what you’d do, Suzuna, if that was the reason.”
“…A hypothetical.”
I repeated her words like a parrot.
“But you didn’t really say anything, and that surprised me. I thought you’d react more.”
Riri-chan’s arms unwrapped from around my neck.
My hair swayed slightly as she stood up.
She walked towards the door.
“Sorry for making you uncomfortable. It wasn’t a very funny joke. I’ll go make some tea and snacks.”
Riri-chan opened the door, about to head to the living room.
“W-Wait.”
I called out to her.
“What?”
Riri-chan didn’t turn around.
“About that hypothetical… who did you mean…?”
“Who do you mean?”
Riri-chan is teasing me, even though she knows what I’m asking.
“Me or Shindo-kun? Who did you say you liked?”
I’m curious.
What was she thinking, what was she feeling when she brought up that hypothetical?
Even if it was a joke, I wanted to know the root of those feelings.
“Which one did you think, Suzuna?”
“Eh…”
But Riri-chan wouldn’t answer directly.
She asked me a question instead.
And it wasn’t just any question; it was a difficult one to answer.
“I asked you first.”
“But I was the one who brought it up, so if you want to know, you have to tell me first, Suzuna.”
That’s not fair.
Riri-chan’s way of speaking is unfair.
Trying to get me to reveal my feelings first like that.
She did the same thing before and didn’t answer my question properly.
“Which one did you want me to say, Suzuna?”
I don’t know.
We weren’t talking about that.
I just wanted to hear what Riri-chan had to say.
“I don’t really know…”
“…I see.”
Riri-chan replied weakly to my vague answer.
She seemed to relax and turned around.
Her expression was her usual casual smile.
“Well, either way, it was just a joke, right?”
She laughed it off, as if it wasn’t a big deal.
She created an atmosphere as if it was just a casual remark, an extension of our everyday conversation.
“I’ll go make some tea and snacks. Ah, or do you want something else to drink?”
“…Anything is fine.”
“Okay.”
Riri-chan left the room.
She acted like it was nothing, as if she wasn’t bothered at all.
I was left alone in the room.
“…A joke, huh?”
But a part of me was annoyed that she was dismissing it as a joke.
Was I… expecting something?
Was I hoping for a confession, that she was interfering with Shindo-kun and me because she liked me?
What would happen if that were true?
Could I reciprocate those feelings?
Even questioning myself only highlighted the vague emotions swirling within me.
“Sorry to keep you waiting. I made tea after all. I don’t have much in the way of snacks, though.”
Then what if Riri-chan likes Shindo-kun?
Then I can avoid the bad ending with Shindo-kun.
That should be a good thing.
I’d spend less time with Riri-chan, but I could avoid the future I dread the most.
“Hey, are you listening?”
But I’m still not convinced.
I tried to deceive myself, but it’s impossible.
I don’t think Riri-chan would end up with Shindo-kun.
I don’t want to see that future either.
“Hey, Suzuna.”
“Wh-What?”
Riri-chan’s face was suddenly next to mine.
She had crawled over to me on all fours and was peering at my face.
Her loose neckline revealed a glimpse of her chest because of her unguarded posture.
Not again, I thought, and quickly averted my gaze.
“Why do you have that troubled look on your face?”
Riri-chan, seeing my reaction, slightly misunderstood.
“…I don’t.”
“You did. Are you still bothered by what I said earlier?”
Please don’t act like it’s nothing when you were the one who brought it up.
“No, I’m not bothered.”
“It was just a common joke.”
Maybe that kind of joke is common.
But I don’t find it funny.
It felt like Riri-chan was pulling away, and I didn’t like it.
“Hey, Suzuna, I’m sorry.”
Seeing my silence, Riri-chan apologized apologetically.
“…Do you want me to forgive you?”
I asked, still looking away.
“Yeah. You seem upset, Suzuna.”
Of course I am; Riri-chan is the reason.
Just because it was a joke doesn’t mean she can say anything.
So I—
“Then take it off.”
“…Eh?”
Now it was Riri-chan’s turn to be surprised.
I turned my gaze back to Riri-chan.
“I said, take it off.”
“Eh, w-wait, Suzuna…?!”
I pushed Riri-chan down.
Straddling her, I looked down. Her open shirt revealed her chest.
This is annoying… her unguarded appearance, the way she’s messing with my emotions…
I felt like I was losing control of my suppressed feelings.
“S-Suzuna, what is this?”
What is this?
I want to know!
Riri-chan is the one who messed with my emotions, so she should take responsibility.
So I should be able to do whatever I want to Riri-chan.
“You want me to forgive you, right? Then be quiet.”
“B-But…”
Even as she protested, Riri-chan didn’t resist seriously.
So I reached for the buttons of her blouse.
------------------ 
59 I Want to Bite
I put my hand on the buttons of her blouse and undid them one by one.
“Suzuna, what are you doing all of a sudden…?”
Riri-chan tried to grab my hand to stop me.
But her grip was weak.
I shouldn’t be able to overpower her.
Riri-chan was saying no, but she seemed hesitant.
It’s probably because she feels guilty towards me.
“Let go.”
I spoke as coldly as possible.
I thought she would listen to me if I did that.
“What’s wrong, Suzuna? You’re different from usual.”
Who made me this way?
Since she doesn’t even understand that at this point, I have to teach her a lesson.
“I’m angry, Riri-chan.”
“I know, I know, that’s why I apologized.”
“I don’t forgive you.”
“Suzuna…”
Riri-chan is the one who always manipulates me with these kinds of words.
So she can’t complain about receiving the same treatment.
What goes around comes around.
“If you want me to forgive you, let go.”
“…”
When I pressed her, Riri-chan obediently let go of my hand.
There were no more interruptions.
I undid all the buttons of her blouse.
Her white bra and the round swellings it encased were revealed.
Riri-chan has the largest breasts among the heroines.
Maybe that’s why many of her CGs emphasized her chest.
I thought those suggestive depictions, needlessly arousing desire, were a bit vulgar.
But seeing them in person…
“They’re beautiful.”
“H-Hey, what are you looking at?”
You know what I’m looking at.
Riri-chan blushed.
I lowered my gaze, and her skirt was slightly disheveled.
I could almost see the tops of her thighs.
—Touch
I touched her exposed leg.
I ran my hand along her thigh, from the front to the inside.
“Where are you touching…?”
The smooth texture of her skin, the soft flesh giving way under my fingertips.
Beautiful, yet lewd.
Riri-chan is crazy for always exposing such alluring legs.
“Hey, Riri-chan, why do you always wear such short skirts?”
“H-Huh? It’s just… because short skirts are cute, that’s all.”
She exposes such an alluring body to the public gaze without a second thought.
Riri-chan, unconsciously, captivates my gaze.
And today, her words stirred up my emotions even further.
Unforgivable.
I have to punish her.
Otherwise, my heart won’t find balance.
“I-Isn’t that enough…?”
Riri-chan pleaded.
No, it’s not.
I can’t forgive her after this.
“Riri-chan, it hasn’t even begun yet. Stay still.”
“W-Wait, Suzuna…”
I ran my tongue along Riri-chan’s neck.
Savoring the sensation, I licked her skin.
“Seriously, that’s dangerous.”
What’s dangerous about it?
Riri-chan is the one who always does this kind of thing.
Since she’s the one who encouraged this behavior, it’s strange for her to stop me now.
So I won’t stop.
I moved my tongue downwards, and the texture changed to a soft suppleness.
The swell of her breasts, covered in white fabric, touched the tip of my nose.
“Suzuna, really… stop…”
Riri-chan’s hand touched my head, as if to stop me.
But I brushed her hand away.
“Don’t get in the way, Riri-chan.”
“But that’s dangerous…”
“What’s dangerous about it?”
“You should know without me telling you.”
I’m just licking the swell of her breasts, the cleavage.
I haven’t touched anything beyond that, and her bra is still on.
“Suzuna, why are you suddenly doing this?”
“Why…?”
Because I’m angry at you, Riri-chan.
You’ve been so considerate of me, and then you suddenly tested me like that.
It made me feel uneasy, like you might leave me.
If you like Shindo-kun, you’ll leave me, won’t you?
That’s not fun.
So I buried my face in Riri-chan’s chest again.
“You’re still going?”
I don’t want to be left alone again.
So I thought I should leave a mark, so you can’t go anywhere.
This soft spot is perfect for leaving a mark.
I lightly bit Riri-chan’s breast.
It felt so soft that I wanted to bite harder.
“Ouch… Suzuna, that hurts…”
Riri-chan’s pained voice.
I’m happy to hear a side of her I’ve never heard before.
Because I know that what I’m doing is changing her.
Hearing her voice, I looked up.
Her white skin was slightly red where I bit her.
“What’s this…? I don’t understand…”
“This will make you reflect, Riri-chan.”
“I’ve never heard of this kind of reflection…”
Not only the bite mark, but Riri-chan’s face was also red.
While I’m doing this, Riri-chan’s emotions must be completely focused on me.
So I want to leave a clear bite mark.
Then maybe she’ll only think about me.
“It’s not enough.”
It’s just a part of her upper body.
I want to lick her entire body, bite her in various places.
Otherwise, I’m afraid she’ll disappear somewhere.
I want to leave concrete proof to keep her by my side.
I looked at Riri-chan’s skirt and her legs.
Maybe I need to leave a mark here too.
“Suzuna, no!”
But Riri-chan must have noticed my gaze.
As soon as I looked in that direction, she let out a firm refusal, unlike before.
She grabbed my head, truly trying to stop me.
“What is it, Riri-chan?”
“That’s dangerous.”
“You said that before.”
“No, I’m serious this time.”
So biting her chest is a joke?
…I don’t understand, but Riri-chan’s voice sounded like she genuinely wanted me to stop.
“If you go any further, I’ll really… lose it.”
A warning.
But her voice was trembling.
Riri-chan’s voice, which messed with my emotions, is now being messed with by me.
That’s good.
Now she understands my feelings a little.
“Okay, I’ll forgive you.”
I pulled away from Riri-chan.
I buttoned her blouse, feeling bad for leaving her like that.
I wasn’t sure how many buttons to do up, but I closed all but the top one.
I shouldn’t expose her like this.
Riri-chan, who was lying on her back, sat up.
She looked at me resentfully.
“What? If you have something to say, say it.”
“You… pervert…”
“Eh…”
Riri-chan is supposed to be the pervert.
Riri-chan continued to look away, avoiding eye contact with me.
60 Bitten: Hinase Riri’s Side
Why… did this happen?
Suzuna is pinning me down.
And she’s straddling me, looking down.
This has never happened before.
“You want me to forgive you, right? Then be quiet.”
Suzuna reached out and touched the buttons of my blouse.
I can’t just let her do this.
“Suzuna, what are you doing all of a sudden…?”
I grabbed Suzuna’s hand and stopped her.
“Let go.”
Her cold, dismissive tone sent chills down my spine.
“Suzuna, you’re different from usual.”
Was it wrong of me to suddenly hug her from behind?
Or was it wrong of me to say “because I like you”?
But it can’t be helped.
I wanted to convey my feelings.
I wanted to see her reaction.
I couldn’t be completely honest, I couldn’t reveal everything.
Because Suzuna is always hiding something.
She has secrets about her relationship with Shindo, and with me.
Because of that, there’s still a distance between our hearts.
Knowing that, I don’t have the courage to reveal everything.
“I’m angry, Riri-chan.”
“I know, I know, that’s why I apologized.”
“I don’t forgive you.”
“Suzuna…”
I don’t want Suzuna to be unforgiving towards me.
If I made her angry, I want to apologize.
Suzuna sometimes gets upset, but she usually just runs away. She’s never expressed her emotions so directly before, so I was taken aback.
“If you want me to forgive you, let go.”
“…”
Overwhelmed by her intensity, I let go of her hand.
Suzuna unbuttoned my blouse without hesitation.
She opened it, exposing my bra.
Suzuna stared at my exposed skin, silently.
It’s embarrassing to be seen like this.
“They’re beautiful.”
Unbelievable.
Just looking and then making that comment…
What does Suzuna want from me?
“H-Hey, what are you looking at?”
—Touch
Suzuna touched my leg, ignoring my flustered state.
Her fingertips were warm, caressing my skin.
She ran her hand along my thigh, from the outside to the inside, as if to confirm the sensation repeatedly.
Her touch wasn’t just a touch; she was trying to… feel me.
My body reacted instinctively, even though she was just touching me.
“Hey, Riri-chan, why do you always wear such short skirts?”
Suzuna spoke to me in her usual casual tone.
Her voice was so indifferent, so out of sync with my feelings, that I felt embarrassed.
“H-Huh? It’s just… because short skirts are cute, that’s all.”
I tried to deflect, forcing myself to sound normal.
I don’t know if she was convinced by my answer, but Suzuna continued to look at me and caress my leg, silently.
“I-Isn’t that enough…?”
If she continues, I’ll lose it.
I’ll get carried away even though Suzuna doesn’t have those intentions.
I don’t want that kind of one-sided relationship.
“Riri-chan, it hasn’t even begun yet. Stay still.”
But Suzuna was relentless.
She continued in her cold tone, probably unaware of how I was feeling.
“W-Wait, Suzuna…”
Then, Suzuna’s tongue touched my neck.
A shiver ran through my body as she licked my skin.
She’s licked me before, but today was different.
My mind felt hazy.
“Seriously, that’s dangerous.”
This is bad.
I’m losing control.
But Suzuna wouldn’t listen.
Her tongue moved downwards, licking my chest.
My senses heightened, becoming incredibly sensitive.
“Suzuna, really… stop…”
This is bad, I thought, and tried to stop her by touching her head.
“Don’t get in the way.”
But she brushed my hand away roughly.
“But that’s dangerous…”
“What’s dangerous about it?”
“You should know without me telling you.”
If this continues, I’ll lose it.
I’ll be the only one feeling this way.
“Suzuna, why are you suddenly doing this?”
“Why…?”
Suzuna didn’t answer.
She’s thinking something, but she won’t say it.
There are so many things she won’t understand unless I tell her, but she refuses to talk about her feelings.
Instead, Suzuna buried her face in my chest again.
Her breath against my skin was hot.
“You’re still going?”
No matter how many times I asked, she didn’t answer.
Her breath against my skin, synchronized with her breathing, turned into my own warmth.
Anyone would feel strange with their face pressed against their chest like that.
I was so embarrassed that I felt like she could hear my pounding heart.
But the warmth gradually turned into a sharp pain.
“Ouch… Suzuna, that hurts…”
Suzuna was biting my breast.
It’s crazy to undress someone, bury your face in their chest, and bite them.
There’s no meaning to this act.
It only hurts me; there’s nothing good about it.
…And yet, I’m enduring Suzuna’s bite.
I could reach out and push her head away, but I don’t.
Because I somehow understand that Suzuna is trying to express something through this act, something she can’t put into words.
It’s incredibly clumsy, but it’s also… very Suzuna-like.
Finally, Suzuna stopped biting and looked up.
I’m sure there’s a teeth mark on my breast.
“What’s this…? I don’t understand…”
“This will make you reflect, Riri-chan.”
“I’ve never heard of this kind of reflection…”
Or rather, I’m too overwhelmed to even think about reflecting.
I’m scared that I’m about to be consumed by Suzuna.
“It’s not enough.”
But Suzuna wasn’t satisfied.
Suzuna looked away from my chest and glanced at my skirt and legs.
I instinctively knew she was coming for them next.
And her gaze was fixed on a very… dangerous spot.
“Suzuna, no!”
I cried out reflexively.
“…?”
Suzuna didn’t seem to understand why I said no.
Unbelievable.
She’s doing this to me, and she doesn’t even understand.
“If you go any further, I’ll really… lose it.”
Since she doesn’t understand, I have to tell her clearly.
If this continues, I’ll really lose it.
I don’t want that.
I don’t want my feelings to run ahead of Suzuna’s.
I want our feelings to be in sync.
I told myself that, suppressing the urge to struggle.
“Okay, I’ll forgive you.”
Did she understand? Or was she satisfied with biting me?
Anyway, Suzuna’s voice softened slightly.
She buttoned my blouse.
I felt like Suzuna’s dress-up doll.
Suzuna moved off me, and I was finally free.
I sat up, and there was Suzuna, with her usual grumpy expression.
“What? If you have something to say, Riri-chan, say it.”
Something to say?
What does she want to hear?
“You… pervert…”
“Eh…”
I realized something.
Just being touched by Suzuna makes my body tingle.
And it was so one-sided.
It wasn’t gentle; it was closer to an act of aggression.
But I felt it.
So what will happen to me if Suzuna gets serious?
I’m curious, and yet I’m also afraid.
Because if I find out, I don’t think I’ll be able to resist getting closer to Suzuna.
I’m so messed up.
I don’t know how to face Suzuna anymore.
------------------ 
61 Treated Like a Child
“…”
“…”
The silence is heavy…
Riri-chan is looking away, not making eye contact with me.
And I’m frozen, unsure of what to do, watching her.
I’m starting to calm down, thinking I might have gone too far.
“R-Riri-chan…?”
Riri-chan’s shoulders twitched.
“Wh-What…?”
She replied, still facing away from me.
“Um… are you okay?”
I think I might have overwhelmed Riri-chan with my confusing emotions.
But it’s also true that I felt like I was losing it if I didn’t do something.
So right now, I’m a little calmer.
Now that I’ve calmed down, I’m realizing I might have gone too far, but…
“Well, I was just wondering… what you were thinking, Suzuna…”
“What I was thinking… I was just punishing you for making me angry.”
Hearing that, Riri-chan finally turned to face me.
She pointed at her left breast.
“This. Why did you do this?”
It’s probably about the bite mark, even though it’s not visible through her blouse.
“I told you, it was a punishment.”
“You didn’t have to go that far, did you?”
“I did.”
“Why? It hurt.”
Despite saying it hurt, Riri-chan’s voice didn’t sound angry.
It sounded more like… confusion.
“It wouldn’t be a punishment if it didn’t hurt.”
“Do you usually give your friends painful punishments?”
“Is it wrong to give your friend a painful punishment?”
“It is, normally.”
But even as she said that, Riri-chan didn’t seem genuinely upset.
And yet, she also said this wasn’t something you’d do to a normal friend.
So that means I’m in a different position from Tachibana-san and the others.
That might make me a little happy.
“You bit me pretty hard.”
“I held back. I actually wanted to bite harder.”
And I wanted to bite other places too.
I don’t feel that way now that I’ve calmed down, but…
I really did think that earlier.
“…Suzuna, are you… actually a sadist?”
Riri-chan seemed genuinely bewildered.
She probably wasn’t expecting that kind of response.
“I don’t think so.”
“Well, you wouldn’t have done that otherwise…”
Is that true?
But I don’t want to hurt anyone else.
I just… couldn’t feel at ease unless I left a mark on Riri-chan.
“You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to punish, Riri-chan.”
“I’m not a masochist, you know.”
I know that…
But I’m relieved that Riri-chan isn’t angry.
“…So, what now?”
“What do you mean?”
Riri-chan didn’t seem to understand my question.
“Are we going to continue studying?”
I pointed at the notebooks and textbooks on the low table.
I feel bad for letting the tea she made get cold.
Riri-chan blinked, looked at the table, and then back at me.
“Is that even possible?”
“…No, I guess not.”
The study session ended there.
◇◇◇
It was late at night.
I decided to go home.
I packed my study materials into my bag, stood up, and headed for the door.
“I’ll walk you home.”
Riri-chan stood up too.
“It’s fine, I’m not a child.”
I won’t get lost on the way to the elevator or the entrance.
There’s no need to be so overprotective.
“You’re basically a child.”
“Huh?”
It doesn’t make sense to be treated like a child when we’re the same age.
I think we’re both still somewhat children and somewhat adults.
It’s not right to be unilaterally treated like a child.
“A non-child wouldn’t bite someone’s chest just because they’re angry.”
I was momentarily speechless.
“You can’t express your emotions unless you physically lash out, can you? It’s fine, I understand.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Her condescending tone threw me off.
I was the one in control earlier, but now that some time has passed, Riri-chan is back to her usual self, and I feel like I’m the one being tamed.
“I’ll accept your childish behavior, Suzuna. I’m like a mother to you.”
“…”
I’m starting to want to bite her again.
But if I do that, I can already imagine Riri-chan saying, “There, there, you’re such a child,” as if she understands me perfectly.
So I’ll hold back.
“…That was a punishment.”
My frustrated words trailed off and probably didn’t reach her.
◇◇◇
I left the apartment, walked down the hallway, and got into the elevator.
Only the impersonal whirring of the motor echoed in the elevator as we descended.
“Suzuna, what are you eating for dinner tonight?”
She’ll probably say something if I say instant ramen.
“…I’ll probably buy something at the convenience store.”
“Seriously, it’s always that, isn’t it?”
So it’s the same thing after all.
Either way, I’m labeled as someone who doesn’t take care of herself.
“Of course.”
“I don’t know what’s ‘of course’ about that, but I’m worried.”
Riri-chan sighed, looking exasperated.
She’s been treating me like a child this whole time.
“I’m fine.”
“With that skinny body? You’re not eating properly, are you?”
“I am. My body type is just… my constitution.”
“…Are you being sarcastic?”
Riri-chan looked me up and down resentfully.
I was just stating a fact; it’s Amatsuki Suzuna’s body type, after all.
But for some reason, it sounded like sarcasm to Riri-chan.
“Why would you say that?”
“I’m putting in so much effort… and this is what I get…”
Riri-chan compared her body to mine.
In terms of slenderness, Amatsuki Suzuna is definitely thinner.
But Riri-chan isn’t fat; she just has a healthy figure.
If anything, Amatsuki Suzuna is too thin.
“You’re overthinking it.”
“Hmm, slender people sure are carefree.”
…She sounds jealous.
What happened to treating me like a child?
Riri-chan is the childish one now.
“I like your figure better, Riri-chan. It’s cuter.”
“…What do you mean, ‘cute’?”
“Soft and… cute.”
I recalled the feeling of Riri-chan’s legs when I touched them earlier.
Compared to that, my stick-like legs are bony and unattractive.
“Stop remembering that!”
Riri-chan waved her hands dismissively.
…Well, she’s right.
I shouldn’t have said that in front of her.
We arrived at the first floor while chatting about nonsense.
We went through the entrance and stepped outside.
“I’ll make you dinner again sometime.”
“…It’s too much trouble, so it’s okay.”
“No, I’m worried about your health, Suzuna.”
Is she really that worried about me that she wants to be my mother?
Well, Riri-chan’s cooking is delicious, so I don’t have a good reason to refuse.
“Sometime.”
“Yeah, I’ll make you whatever you want.”
Riri-chan smiled happily.
“Then I’ll be going.”
“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”
We waved goodbye and parted ways.
62 Things Seem Normal, But They’re Not
During class.
The teacher’s monotone voice and the rhythmic tapping of chalk against the blackboard induced drowsiness.
Since it was close to the test, I tried to fight off the sleepiness and focus on the lesson.
“Zzz…”
However, Shindo Minato, the boy sitting in front of me, had completely succumbed to sleep, his face buried in his desk.
Seriously, this guy.
This is hardly the behavior of someone who asked me for help studying yesterday.
As a heroine, the correct course of action would be to wake him up and trigger an event.
But I don’t want to increase my intimacy level with him, so I decided to leave him alone.
◇◇◇
Break time.
Riri-chan was chatting with Tachibana-san and her other female friends.
Riri-chan was the center of attention, with the others gathered around her.
I watched Riri-chan from afar.
I wonder what they’re talking about.
Riri-chan was nodding along, occasionally laughing happily.
It’s normal for her to get along with others, so I don’t intend to say anything about it.
But her laughter seemed different from when she’s with me.
She seems to have more fun when she’s talking to me.
I had that pointless thought.
◇◇◇
Lunch break.
“Suzuna, it’s lunchtime.”
“Ah, okay.”
Riri-chan came to my desk with her bento box.
Shindo-kun was sleeping at his desk today, so Riri-chan borrowed a nearby chair and sat next to me.
I wonder how long he’s going to sleep…
“Here, eat.”
She opened the bento box and handed it to me.
Hamburg steak, tamagoyaki, tomatoes, and stir-fried vegetables.
It looked very colorful and appetizing.
“I’m happy, but I feel bad that you’re always making lunch for me…”
“Don’t worry about it. Making lunch for one person or two people is the same amount of effort.”
“That might be true, but…”
Even so, I don’t think it’s healthy to have a friend make lunch for you every day.
“If I don’t do this, you’ll just eat sandwiches every day, right? That’s not good for you.”
Lately, Riri-chan has become increasingly motherly.
What does she want, taking care of me so much?
“There’s also the cost, you know.”
Even if the effort is the same, the cost of ingredients is doubled.
I feel bad about burdening her.
But I’m also hesitant to give her money, so I’d prefer if she just stopped making lunch for me altogether.
“You can pay me with your body.”
But Riri-chan ignored my concerns and said something strange with a grin.
“My… body…?”
Does she mean… that?
But no one would want my body; I don’t have any feminine charm.
Riri-chan, with her womanly figure, is the one in demand…
…My gaze naturally drifted up and down Riri-chan’s body.
“Hey, that’s not what I meant.”
Riri-chan, noticing my gaze, twisted her body to hide her chest.
Her flustered reaction told me she knew what I was thinking.
“Anyway, don’t worry about my bento! Just eat, Suzuna.”
That makes it sound like she’s feeding a pet.
“That makes me your pet, Riri-chan.”
“It’s fine, be my pet.”
She actually agreed.
There’s no way you can have a human as a pet.
And what would she even do with a pet like me?
◇◇◇
P.E. class.
Volleyball again, apparently.
The teams were the same as last time, and I joined a group of people I’m neither close to nor dislike.
Riri-chan was with Tachibana-san and her group again.
My volleyball performance was… adequate. I didn’t excel, but I didn’t drag the team down either.
Thanks to Kanaori-san and Riri-chan’s coaching, I can now receive the ball, so I’m much less of a burden.
My team won our first game and waited for the next match.
I quickly retreated to a corner of the gymnasium and sat down.
Even the people I just played with would leave after the game since we’re not usually in the same group.
I dislike this awkward atmosphere, but I also don’t want to be with them all the time.
Maybe it would be more comfortable if I had friends at times like these.
“Here, Riri.”
“Leave it to me!”
The next game was Riri-chan’s team’s turn.
As always, she excelled with her exceptional athleticism.
Watching Riri-chan enjoy playing sports—
“Because I like you.”
—I remembered her words from last night.
That ambiguous statement, implying she liked either Shindo-kun or me.
Come to think of it, Riri-chan hasn’t really talked to Shindo-kun properly yet.
I did ask her once if she was interested in him, and she immediately denied it.
But she didn’t say that in front of Shindo-kun.
The other heroines clearly stated they weren’t interested in him, right in front of him.
Thinking about it, Riri-chan might actually have feelings for Shindo-kun, even if she doesn’t say it.
Then is there a possibility that she likes me?
Would Riri-chan like me, someone who isn’t the protagonist, or even a boy?
Riri-chan also said that her “because I like you” was a joke.
So there’s a chance she doesn’t feel anything at all.
“That’s the end!”
—Thud
The sound of the volleyball hitting the court.
Riri-chan had successfully scored a point with her attack.
“Riri, you’re as athletic as ever.”
“That’s because Kaede gives me good tosses.”
I felt a pang of discomfort watching that scene before.
But I don’t feel anything now.
The bite mark I left on Riri-chan’s left breast…
As long as that mark remains, I can feel at ease, like she belongs to me.
------------------ 
63 How We Interact: Hinase Riri’s Side
“Hey, Riri, aren’t you a little too close to Amatsuki lately?”
Kaede suddenly said that during break time.
It’s rare for Kaede to bring up Suzuna’s name.
“It’s nothing, we’re just friends.”
“Is that so? I think it’s unusual for you, Riri.”
“What’s unusual?”
“You don’t usually interact with… quiet girls like that.”
There’s a hint of a barb in her tone.
“Suzuna’s just quiet because she’s not good at talking to people. She talks a lot once you get to know her.”
“Isn’t that what ‘quiet’ means?”
“…What are you trying to say?”
Kaede sometimes mixes subtle digs into seemingly normal conversations.
But she’s good at it, never going too far, so if I get angry, I’ll be the one who seems short-tempered.
“I was just wondering how you and Amatsuki became so close. You’re completely different.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘types.’”
Suzuna is just bad at expressing her emotions. She’s a cute girl once you talk to her.
I don’t like it when people talk about her like she’s a different species.
“Is that so? I don’t really know her.”
“That’s because you’re not trying to.”
“Then maybe I should get to know her.”
“What?”
“Introduce me to Amatsuki.”
It’s rare for Kaede to say something like that, and I don’t understand why.
“What do you want to do that for?”
“You seem close to her, Riri, so I’m curious about what kind of person she is.”
“We talked before, didn’t we?”
Kaede talked to Suzuna when she took off her glasses and changed her hairstyle.
“That doesn’t count.”
“You should have a general idea.”
“No, I don’t.”
“Then maybe you’re not compatible.”
I tried to end the conversation there.
I don’t think talking about Suzuna with Kaede will lead to anything good.
“Hmm… so you don’t want to introduce me, Riri.”
Kaede’s lips curled into a slight smile.
She knows what I’m thinking, and yet she’s trying to continue the conversation.
“It’s because Suzuna’s not good at that kind of thing.”
“You know a lot about Amatsuki.”
Kaede’s tone was still suggestive.
“You’d know that much if you were close.”
“Then why don’t you introduce me to her since we’re close?”
“I told you, I’m not doing it. You’re being persistent.”
If Kaede is curious, she can just talk to Suzuna herself.
There’s no need to go through me.
“But you were trying to include Amatsuki in our group at first.”
“That was a while ago. It’s not relevant now.”
It’s true that I tried to do that when I first met Suzuna.
But as I got to know her, I realized she didn’t like that kind of thing, so I stopped.
“So you’re saying you’re prioritizing Amatsuki over me?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“It’s normal to introduce friends to each other, but you’re refusing, Riri.”
“That’s because…”
“You’re saying ‘Suzuna is bad at socializing.’ But you’re prioritizing Amatsuki, whose wishes you haven’t even heard yet, over my request, Riri.”
Kaede is being strangely persistent today.
“You even make lunch for her. Is she that important to you?”
I knew someone would say that eventually, and it was Kaede.
“Suzuna lives alone and always eats junk food. That’s why I make lunch for her.”
Our situations are different from those who live with their parents and have someone make lunch for them.
She should understand that reason.
“You’re talking about her like she’s your girlfriend.”
“…Huh?”
I was taken aback and speechless.
“You sound like those girls who say, ‘My sweetie always eats junk food, so I have to make him food because I’m worried!’ …That’s how you seem to me, Riri, in your attitude towards Amatsuki.”
Kaede’s voice went up an octave, and she blinked rapidly, imitating a lovesick girl.
She was a completely different person from her usual self.
“That’s how it seems to me.”
Then she returned to her usual low-key tone.
The gap is too much.
“No, it’s not like that.”
I guess this is what Kaede wanted to ask all along.
That was a long-winded lead-up.
“…Well, yeah, you’re both girls.”
Kaede chuckled.
Those words weighed heavily on my heart.
“Well, I guess that kind of thing is normal nowadays. But I’d be surprised if you were… that way inclined, Riri.”
“…So you think so, Kaede.”
“You still don’t have a boyfriend, Riri. I’d be worried if… girls were your type.”
So what if they are?
“So you should be careful about how you interact with her, before strange rumors start spreading.”
“Strange rumors…?”
“Hinase Riri, the girl who rejected countless boys, is now making lunch for another girl? It’s only natural for people to think that way.”
That makes it sound like I’m doing something strange.
What’s wrong with liking Suzuna and making lunch for her?
“I’ve warned you. If you want to navigate school life smoothly, you should do everything in moderation.”
Kaede continued to smile cheerfully until the end.
◇◇◇
“Suzuna, it’s lunchtime.”
During lunch break, I went to Suzuna’s desk with her bento.
Kaede said that, but she’s overthinking it.
It’s true that I have feelings for Suzuna, but no one would figure that out just from a bento.
“Ah, okay. Thank you…”
Suzuna has been calm lately.
Before, she’d get jealous just from seeing me with Kaede.
Suzuna must have seen me talking to Kaede during break time and playing volleyball with her during P.E., but she didn’t say anything.
…Does that mean she’s not interested in me anymore?
“I’d be worried if… girls were your type.”
Kaede’s words from earlier replayed in my mind.
Would Suzuna also be unable to accept that kind of relationship?
…If so, that would be… upsetting.
“I was talking to Kaede earlier, and she said she’s interested in you.”
So I tried this tactic.
I want to make her jealous.
If she gets jealous like before, I can believe that she also has feelings for me.
If she remains indifferent, I’ll start to worry that I’m the only one feeling this way.
“…Well, I’m not interested in her.”
A blunt reply.
That’s the usual Suzuna, not overreacting to Kaede’s name.
How boring.
I opened the bento box and placed it in front of Suzuna.
“So she asked me to introduce you to her, what do you think?”
Suzuna didn’t look at me.
She looked down and spoke in a bored tone.
“Riri-chan, are you listening? I said I’m not interested.”
“…Ah, okay.”
“Well, I’ll talk to her if she comes over, but I don’t want to go through the trouble of introducing you two if you don’t want to.”
A noncommittal answer.
Apparently, Suzuna no longer has any strong feelings about my relationship with Kaede.
Before, she’d get upset just from that and start practicing volleyball alone.
She seems to have cooled down considerably.
“…”
Then Suzuna froze, looking at her bento.
What’s wrong? She usually eats without saying anything.
“Suzuna, what’s wrong?”
“…Spinach.”
“Spinach?”
I included spinach ohitashi in today’s bento.
I have to make sure she eats her vegetables; otherwise, she’ll just eat noodles forever at home.
But today, she stopped.
“Do you… hate it?”
Suzuna nodded.
“I didn’t know that…”
I asked her about her likes and dislikes before making her bento.
“I hate it so much that I erased it from my memory.”
“What’s that supposed to mean…”
Suzuna occasionally says strange things.
“It’s fine, you don’t have to force yourself to eat it. Just leave it.”
“O-Okay…”
But Suzuna’s hand reached for the spinach.
She picked up a small portion with her chopsticks and brought it to her mouth.
“Suzuna?”
“…Huu.”
She took a breath and put it in her mouth.
“…!”
Suzuna’s face turned pale, and she chewed, trembling slightly.
She really does hate it.
“Eh, why are you eating it?”
What’s with her, saying she hates it and then eating it? What’s going on in her mind?
“…I can’t… leave it.”
“I told you it’s fine to leave it.”
“I can’t.”
“Why not?”
“Because you made it, Riri-chan.”
“Eh…”
Suzuna, still trembling slightly, reached for the remaining spinach.
“So I’ll eat it.”
“You don’t usually eat spinach?”
“I absolutely never eat it.”
“Ah, I see…”
Suzuna is so unfair.
She just pretended to be indifferent and made me feel down, and now she’s suddenly making me happy.
My heart changes color so easily with a single word or action from Suzuna.
64 My Mark
Riri-chan is talking to Tachibana-san during break time.
It’s a common sight, nothing unusual.
It was only recently that I started feeling uneasy about it.
The burning emotion that was smoldering within me was extinguished by biting Riri-chan’s breast.
But it’s been four days since I went to Riri-chan’s house.
The mark must be gone by now.
I started feeling restless again.
Knowing that ripples were forming in my once calm emotions, I stopped looking at Riri-chan.
There’s no point in harboring these feelings.
I just want to live a peaceful life.
◇◇◇
“Suzuna, it’s lunchtime.”
Riri-chan brought me lunch when lunch break started.
It’s become a routine, but this isn’t normal.
Classmate, friend… it’s strange to have someone make lunch for you, no matter the relationship.
“Ah, okay. Thank you…”
I bowed my head in thanks.
It’s strange that I feel such dark emotions just from seeing Riri-chan, who does so much for me, talking to another friend.
I have to act normal, like it’s nothing.
“I was talking to Kaede earlier. She said she’s interested in you.”
Even though I just resolved to act normal, Riri-chan brought up Tachibana-san’s name, as if testing me.
I felt the flames of my suppressed emotions flare up.
She knows I don’t like this.
She knows I have negative feelings towards Tachibana-san.
Why is she saying this?
“…Well, I’m not interested in her.”
But I’m not a child.
I’m trying to understand and manage my own emotions.
I replied calmly, maintaining my usual tone.
Riri-chan placed the bento box in front of me.
“So she asked me to introduce you. What do you think?”
She’s persistent.
There’s no way I’d want to be introduced to someone I’m not interested in.
Riri-chan should know that.
But calm down.
It’s okay, I can stay calm.
I looked up at Riri-chan’s left breast.
…No, the mark that kept me calm is gone.
The peace within me slowly crumbled.
“Riri-chan, are you listening? I said I’m not interested.”
“…Ah, okay.”
A curt reply.
Riri-chan also didn’t seem very enthusiastic, despite what she said.
Then she shouldn’t have asked.
“Well, I’ll talk to her if she comes over, but I don’t want to go through the trouble of introducing you two if you don’t care.”
I barely managed to hold it together.
Good, Riri-chan didn’t notice.
After that, I froze, seeing spinach in the bento.
First Tachibana-san, now spinach…
I briefly wondered if Riri-chan was deliberately trying to annoy me.
But Riri-chan’s expression was genuinely apologetic, so I realized I was overthinking it.
So I ate it all.
It would be rude to leave it after she went through the trouble of making it.
“…Thank you for the meal.”
I thanked her and returned the bento box.
“You’re welcome.”
Riri-chan smiled happily.
She took the bento box and efficiently packed it away.
“I’m really sorry about this every day.”
“Ahaha, I’m doing it because I want to. But Kaede also said something earlier. She said we’re too close, making lunch for each other and all.”
Even after lunch, she’s still talking about Tachibana-san.
“…So?”
“Eh? Well, she said I should do things in moderation, or I won’t be able to maintain my relationships smoothly… but I don’t really care.”
Riri-chan laughed it off, but…
She doesn’t understand.
Tachibana-san is trying to interfere with our relationship.
I can’t control what other people think.
But I can’t just ignore it.
I don’t like Tachibana-san, and I don’t like Riri-chan’s reaction.
A burning emotion rose from the pit of my stomach.
I stood up.
“Suzuna?”
“Come with me.”
“Where?”
“Just come.”
“Ah, okay…?”
I led Riri-chan out of the classroom without giving her a chance to refuse.
We walked down the hallway to the music room.
I opened the door.
It was empty.
“It’s been a while since we came here together, Riri-chan.”
Back in April, when I first met Riri-chan.
In this music room, she forced me to call her “Riri” instead of “Hinase-san.”
Calling each other by our first names strengthened our bond.
“Hey, Suzuna, what are you planning, bringing me here?”
Riri-chan grinned mischievously and dramatically put her arm around her own shoulder.
She probably thinks she’s being playful, but she might be right.
“Take it off.”
“…Huh?”
Riri-chan blinked.
“Unbutton your blouse.”
“…Um, is this… some kind of roleplay?”
Riri-chan seemed to understand the situation, but she also seemed bewildered.
“It’s not roleplay, so hurry up.”
“What if someone comes in?”
“That’s why I’m telling you to hurry.”
“Ah, no, that’s not what I meant. Why are you making me do this?”
I don’t want to tell her the reason.
“Just take it off.”
“No way, I’m not just going to take it off like that.”
“Why not? You did it before.”
I brought up the incident at Riri-chan’s house for the first time.
She also remembered and her eyes widened in surprise.
“…That was because you took it off, Suzuna.”
“It’s the same thing. You accepted it, Riri-chan.”
“You were angry, so I let you.”
I see. That’s how she’s playing it.
“I’m still angry.”
“Why?”
Don’t play dumb.
Riri-chan definitely knows.
“You know why.”
“I haven’t done anything to make you angry. Is it about the spinach?”
“It’s not that.”
“Then what is it?”
Why does she want me to say it so badly?
She’s mean.
“Kaede, Kaede, Kaede… it’s annoying.”
“Ahh, is Suzuna jealous again?”
“I’m not.”
“You are.”
Riri-chan’s lips curled into a slight smile.
A confident smile.
Maybe this is the reaction she wanted to see.
But my anger isn’t stemming from jealousy.
“You deliberately brought up Tachibana-san’s name to make me angry.”
“…Um…”
Riri-chan is honest, so she couldn’t reply immediately when I hit the mark.
My suspicion turned into conviction.
“That’s what annoys me. It’s fine if you have a valid reason to bring up her name, but it doesn’t make sense to do it just to make me angry.”
“Well, that’s… you see…”
“You’re caught red-handed. Since you did it intentionally, apologize.”
“Ugh…”
Riri-chan was cornered.
This is what happens when you act out of character.
“Sorry, Suzuna… I…”
“You don’t have to apologize.”
“Huh? You just told me to—”
—Thud
I pushed Riri-chan’s chest.
Riri-chan’s back hit the wall, and she had nowhere to go.
“Show me your apology with your actions.”
“So what do you want me to do…?”
I pointed at her blouse.
“Take it off.”
“Seriously…?”
“Hurry up.”
“And you’re not even going to do it for me this time…”
Last time, at Riri-chan’s house, I was the one who undressed her, almost forcefully.
But today is different.
I’m making her undress herself, so she can’t use the excuse that I forced her.
“You want me to forgive you, right?”
“…Sigh…”
Riri-chan obediently untied her ribbon and unbuttoned her blouse.
Her black bra and white breasts were revealed.
The mark I left was gone.
“What are you staring at?”
She’s probably embarrassed to be the only one in her underwear at school.
Riri-chan blushed.
“The bite mark… it’s gone.”
“Of course it is. It fades with time.”
My mark disappeared.
Then Riri-chan might leave me.
I felt a sense of unease welling up within me.
“Are we done?”
“Not yet.”
I moved closer.
“Hey, this is bad if someone sees us.”
“We’re both girls, so it’ll be fine.”
“Well… it’s better than… a boy and a girl… or maybe not…”
Riri-chan was muttering to herself, but I didn’t have time to listen.
I ran my lips along her chest.
“Seriously, so suddenly…”
I bit her right breast this time, since I bit the left one before.
I pressed my lips against her skin, searching for the right spot.
I found a nicely rounded area.
“Here I go.”
“Here I go… you’re not going to…”
I bit down with my front teeth.
“Ouch… Suzuna, be gentle…”
No.
Riri-chan has been mean lately.
I think she deserves to be punished.
So I bit down harder than before.
“Hey, you’re going to tear it!”
Riri-chan’s voice was filled with pain.
I guess I should forgive her now.
I stopped biting and looked up.
“…There’s a mark.”
A red mark bloomed on Riri-chan’s right breast.
“Of course there is! How hard did you bite?!”
Riri-chan quickly buttoned her blouse.
“I hope it lasts a long time.”
“…No, stop it. I don’t want this mark to stay forever.”
“That’s why it’s good.”
I prefer it if the mark that Riri-chan hates stays forever.
“…What do you mean?”
“Nothing.”
Because it means I’m more deeply etched in her heart.
------------------ 
65 Where Is Our Secret Place?
“Seriously, Suzuna, you’ve been the dangerous one lately.”
Riri-chan hugged herself and distanced herself from me.
“Dangerous?”
“Your… pervertedness.”
“…?”
“Making me undress, biting my chest… I wonder whose influence that is.”
Well, the answer is obvious.
“Your influence, Riri-chan.”
“I haven’t done anything that extreme!”
I think that is what influence means…
But Riri-chan wasn’t listening, so I kept quiet.
As long as the mark remains on Riri-chan’s chest, I can endure a little bit of unreasonable behavior.
“Come on, let’s go back to the classroom.”
Riri-chan took my hand and started walking, as if to say there was no point in staying here any longer.
Despite her words, she’s still leading me.
—Clatter
As we opened the music room door, someone happened to be passing by.
“Hinase-san and Amatsuki-san…? What are you doing here?”
It was the student council president, of all people.
“Ugh, it’s Kanaori…”
“…You have some nerve making such a blatant expression of disgust.”
The two of them were already at odds.
“You’re the one who just happened to walk past us.”
“That’s a ridiculous accusation. In the first place, what were you two doing in the music room during lunch break?”
“I-It’s none of your business!”
Riri-chan, unable to react quickly, just blurted that out.
That’s just asking for Kanaori-san to pry further…
“That’s suspicious. Were you doing something… indecent?”
“N-N-No way!”
Her reaction was as if to say, “Yes, we were.”
Apparently, being bitten by me is considered indecent by Riri-chan.
…Well, I guess it is.
“If that’s the case, you should be able to say it without hesitation. What were you doing?”
“N-Nothing! We were just… reviewing… music!”
“I didn’t know you were so studious.”
“Hmph, I’m focusing on my studies now that I’m a second-year. I can be serious when I want to.”
“It’s strange that such a studious person would be reviewing music, which isn’t even on the midterm exam, three days before the test.”
“…Um…”
You dug your own grave, Riri-chan.
“And your face is redder than usual, isn’t it?”
“H-Hey, that’s not true!”
…It’s probably because she was embarrassed about undressing…
But I can’t say that.
“Your flustered state is proof enough. Why don’t you just confess what you were doing?”
“I wasn’t doing anything weird! …Or rather, I was on the receiving end…?”
“The receiving end…?”
She’s talking like she’s the victim.
That makes it sound like I’m the perpetrator.
Kanaori-san’s gaze shifted to me.
Riri-chan, don’t try to shift the blame onto me just because you can’t handle it.
“Amatsuki-san is a calm and composed person. There’s no way she’d do anything strange to an unreasonable person like you. Stop trying to shift the blame with lies.”
But Kanaori-san didn’t believe her at all.
“Hey, I’m not shifting the blame! I’m only telling the truth!”
“Then tell me what you were doing.”
“Well, that’s… ugh…”
Riri-chan was cornered.
She can’t tell anyone that she was bitten on the chest.
So I kept quiet, and so did Riri-chan.
“Well… technically, entering the music room isn’t prohibited, so there’s no problem…”
“S-See? What are you complaining about?”
“But that doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want without permission.”
Kanaori-san’s firm words silenced us.
“I’ll let it slide this time, but please refrain from any actions that could be misunderstood.”
“Yes, I’m sorry…”
“Okay.”
I guess school isn’t a good place for this… since it’ll be suspicious.
But the bite mark on Riri-chan’s chest will disappear soon.
I have to bite her regularly if I want it to stay.
Then… her house again, I guess.
I had that thought.
◇◇◇
The next week, midterms began.
Test periods aren’t very fun.
I don’t know how my grades in this world will affect my future.
But precisely because it’s unknown, I decided I should get decent grades, so I studied diligently.
Thanks to studying with Riri-chan and holding the study session with Shindo-kun and the heroines, I felt somewhat confident about the tests.
After finishing the tests, the days passed by with me going home and reviewing.
◇◇◇
“Finally, it’s over.”
Shindo-kun sat down and stretched widely.
The last midterm exam was finally over.
“Suzuna, how did your tests go?”
Shindo-kun turned around and asked me.
“They were… okay, I guess. I don’t think they were terrible.”
“I see, that’s good.”
“…Yeah.”
“…”
Shindo-kun remained silent, still facing me.
“…How about your tests, Shindo-kun?”
He seemed like he wanted to be asked, so I asked.
“Well… let me see.”
Shindo-kun suddenly looked out the window with a distant gaze.
“Look, Suzuna, there’s a bird flying.”
There were no birds in sight.
“I wonder how it feels to soar through such a vast blue sky.”
It was a cloudy, rainy day, so there were no birds flying.
“What I’m saying is, from the perspective of the Earth, test scores are insignificant.”
He’s talking about an “Earth perspective” when he can only see the view from the classroom window. That’s ridiculous.
“…”
“Say something!”
“You can escape reality all you want, but please don’t force your low-quality poetry on me.”
“That’s harsh!”
Apparently, Shindo-kun’s tests didn’t go well.
It can’t be helped since he didn’t study with any of the heroines.
There was no development between Shindo-kun and the heroines during the midterms, the first event.
But there are still other events.
I’ll just have to prepare for the next one.
I’ll make sure to avoid the bad ending.
“Suzuna, how were your tests?”
Riri-chan called out to me.
“They were decent. How about yours?”
“Hmm. I think I did pretty well. Thanks to you, Suzuna.”
I didn’t really do anything, but I’m happy that she got good results.
“Well, the tests are over! Let’s go home!”
“Yeah.”
We left the school.
66 Rain and Umbrellas
As I headed towards the entrance, a gray sky stretched overhead.
—Pour
The sound of rain hitting the ground and the roof.
I hate rain.
It’s cold, it’s humid, and it makes my hair frizzy.
Nothing good comes of it.
“This rain is crazy.”
Riri-chan also muttered languidly.
The rainy season was approaching, and this was a heavy downpour for just a prelude.
It would be impossible to go home without getting drenched.
“Well, at least we have umbrellas.”
I had a navy blue umbrella, and Riri-chan had a clear plastic one.
So we didn’t have to worry about getting wet.
“Hmm…”
But Riri-chan was looking at her umbrella with a troubled expression.
“Riri-chan?”
Riri-chan started looking around.
As if searching for something.
“Ugh, this is the worst! I forgot my umbrella!”
“Oh dear, that’s too bad.”
Tachibana-san and her friend arrived, sounding disappointed.
Riri-chan noticed them and walked briskly towards them.
“Kaede, you forgot your umbrella?”
“Ah, Riri. Yeah, I didn’t check the weather.”
“Klutz.”
“Leave me alone.”
What’s this?
Did she just leave me to talk to Tachibana-san?
…She’s that eager to talk to her.
It’s fine.
I suddenly felt like going home alone, but I’ll endure it.
I don’t want to act so childish.
“Here.”
Riri-chan offered her umbrella to Tachibana-san.
“Oh, are you offering it to me?”
“Yeah, I’ll lend it to you.”
“Eh, no, I’m just kidding. That would be too much trouble.”
“It’s fine.”
…Hmm.
I see.
She’s that worried about Tachibana-san.
She’s so concerned that she’d run over and lend her her umbrella.
Riri-chan would rather get drenched herself than let Tachibana-san get wet.
Hmm.
It’s fine.
I think I’ll just go home.
“What about you, Riri?”
“Don’t worry about me. See you later.”
Riri-chan practically forced the umbrella on Tachibana-san and hurried back.
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
“…It’s fine.”
“Are you… upset?”
“I’m not.”
“Then look me in the eye.”
“I won’t.”
I don’t want her to look at me with the same eyes she just used to look at Tachibana-san.
I want her to cleanse her eyes first.
“You’re not angry just because I talked to Kaede, are you?”
“It’s not a big deal. And I’m not angry in the first place.”
“Then smile a little.”
“I don’t feel like it.”
“So you are upset.”
“That’s not what I mean.”
I’m not upset that she talked to her.
I’m just a little annoyed that she made such a big deal about lending her her umbrella, as if she’s so important.
“Then you can go home soaking wet, Riri-chan.”
“No way!”
What is she talking about?
“…Then why did you lend her your umbrella?”
“Because Kaede and the others were in trouble.”
“But then you’ll be in trouble, Riri-chan.”
“I won’t. I’ll share your umbrella, Suzuna.”
“…Mine?”
So that means…
“Sharing… an umbrella.”
“…”
I remembered Riri-chan looking around with her umbrella earlier.
“Riri-chan, were you looking for someone to lend your umbrella to so we could share mine?”
Did she really go to such lengths just for that?
“Who knows? But sharing an umbrella isn’t bad, is it?”
“…It is.”
Riri-chan grinned, but I looked away.
“Eh, you hate sharing an umbrella with me that much?”
“I don’t.”
“Then why?”
I don’t hate sharing an umbrella.
But I don’t think she needed to lend hers to Tachibana-san.
She could have lent it to someone else.
“Come on, Suzuna, let me in! I’ll catch a cold!”
“Then catch a cold.”
“Suzuna, you’re being mean!”
Riri-chan started complaining, pouting.
But she’s the one who caused this.
I don’t want to do this either.
“I’m not mean.”
“That attitude is mean.”
“I’m always like this.”
“Ugh, you’re so annoying! Seriously, won’t you let me in?”
“No.”
Riri-chan has been bringing up Kaede-san way too much lately.
I think she deserves to learn a lesson.
“Hmm, fine. If you won’t let me in, Suzuna, I’ll ask Kaede.”
“…”
Now Riri-chan is the one looking away, sulking.
“Is that okay? I’m going.”
Riri-chan asked again, as if to confirm.
Does she think I’ll give in to her attention-seeking behavior?
“…Do what you want.”
That was the trigger.
“You’re so mean, Suzuna! Fine, I’m going!”
Riri-chan sniffled and started walking towards Kaede-san.
“…Seriously…”
I still feel uneasy.
I think I’d feel uneasy either way, but I’d rather not have her share an umbrella with Tachibana-san.
I followed her and grabbed the hem of her blazer.
“…Suzuna? What’s this?”
Riri-chan’s voice was cheerful, happy that I stopped her.
I felt like I was being manipulated, and it annoyed me.
“Hold this.”
I thrust my umbrella at Riri-chan.
“You want to share an umbrella now?”
“I don’t.”
“Then what’s this?”
Riri-chan pointed at the navy blue umbrella I made her hold.
“My hand gets tired holding an umbrella, so you hold it, Riri-chan.”
“…Suzuna.”
“What?”
“You can be more honest, you know?”
Even as she said that, she couldn’t hide her smile.
She’s happy that she got her way.
That annoys me.
“I am being honest. You’re just my servant now, Riri-chan.”
“Hmm?”
Riri-chan smirked and held my umbrella.
“What’s with that face?”
“You’re so cute, Suzuna, no matter what you say.”
“That doesn’t make sense. Just hold the umbrella.”
“Okay, okay.”
It’s ridiculous that we have to talk so much just to share an umbrella.
I started to think that.
“Here you go, my princess.”
We went outside, and Riri-chan held the umbrella.
I probably shouldn’t have called her a “servant.” She called me “princess” or something, but I’ll let it slide.
As I stepped under the umbrella, I heard the pitter-patter of raindrops.
The umbrella, held by Riri-chan, who is taller than me, was a little high.
“Shall we go home?”
“Yeah.”
We started walking side-by-side, our shoulders brushing against each other.
The outside world was dark and gloomy because of the rain.
My vision was blocked by the umbrella, and instead, I could only feel Riri-chan’s presence beside me.
“By the way, I haven’t asked…”
“What?”
“When’s your birthday, Suzuna?”
My birthday…
“June 24th.”
“Eh, it’s soon!”
“Well, next month.”
“Good, I’m glad I asked.”
Riri-chan seemed relieved.
“Do you have any plans that day, Suzuna?”
“Of course not.”
Don’t underestimate an introvert.
“Well, with your family or something…”
I don’t know, but they haven’t contacted me.
It can’t be helped.
“I don’t.”
“Then I’ll celebrate with you.”
“…Really?”
“Of course.”
That might be nice.
I think it’ll be a fun day if I spend it with Riri-chan.
…Then I realized something I had forgotten.
“When’s your birthday, Riri-chan?”
“July 21st.”
“Next month too.”
So that means…
I looked at her, and Riri-chan was also looking at me.
“…What are you looking at?”
“Well, you look like you want to say something, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s eyes sparkled.
She’s making me say it even though she knows what I’m thinking. That’s so Riri-chan.
“…Do you have any plans that day?”
“I’ll cancel them all.”
“…I see.”
It seems like she does have plans, which is also very Riri-chan.
She’s different from me.
“Then, if you’d like, I’ll celebrate with you.”
“Yes! I’m looking forward to it!”
Riri-chan started giggling.
Her reaction was so exaggerated that the umbrella shook.
“Riri-chan, stop moving the umbrella so much! I’m getting wet!”
“Sorry! I was just so happy.”
“You’re not a child anymore.”
“Ehehe, sorry, you got a little wet, didn’t you?”
…Well, it’s fine.
I hate rain, but I don’t mind getting wet if it’s from Riri-chan’s umbrella.
Because she’ll probably get wet with me.
------------------ 
67 Outfits and Glances
“Suzuna, good moooorning…”
On our way to school, we met at a corner in the downtown area and walked together. It had become our usual routine.
Riri-chan, usually energetic, was slumping her shoulders today, her voice lacking its usual pep.
“Riri-chan, good morning. What’s wrong? You seem down.”
“Ugh… it’s too hot. I’m seriously melting.”
By June, the pleasant spring weather had vanished, and the temperature had risen rapidly.
The humidity was also high, making the days hot and sticky.
Riri-chan groaned, her face contorted in a grimace.
“Well, it is hot.”
“And we have the sports festival soon, don’t we? I seriously can’t handle this. I’m thinking of skipping…”
Yes, the sports festival was coming up in mid-June.
It’s a pretty important event, a major one in this dating sim.
I can’t miss this opportunity to raise Shindo Minato’s intimacy level with the heroines.
“I’ll do my best. I’ll definitely see it through.”
“Eh… Suzuna, I didn’t think you were that type.”
Riri-chan’s reaction was a mixture of lethargy and surprise.
It’s a natural reaction, considering I hate sports festivals.
“But there are times when you have to do things you don’t like.”
“…I can’t help but imagine you tripping and falling, Suzuna.”
“Riri-chan, you think I’m clumsy, don’t you?”
“…Aren’t you?”
She’s probably remembering the volleyball incident.
“…Well, just watch.”
I avoided answering directly.
I probably won’t be doing anything impressive at the sports festival anyway.
◇◇◇
“Hey, isn’t it about time for summer to be over?”
Overwhelmed by the heat, Riri-chan said something nonsensical.
I’m still managing, but Riri-chan doesn’t handle the heat well, it seems.
“You’re dressed for summer, though.”
“That’s… true, but…”
It was the season for changing uniforms.
We took off our blazers and wore only the school-designated white vests over our blouses.
Riri-chan rolled up her sleeves, her ribbon loose and her top buttons undone, looking very relaxed. Naturally, her skirt was above the knee.
I, on the other hand, kept my sleeves down and my buttons done up.
“Your slender figure really stands out, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan looked me up and down and made that comment.
“You’re… very… liberated, Riri-chan.”
The thin, soft fabric of the vest emphasized her figure.
Parts that were hidden by the blazer before, especially the fullness of her chest, were now more prominent.
I couldn’t say it directly, so I kept my words vague.
“Aren’t you hot, Suzuna? Why don’t you shorten your skirt or unbutton a few buttons? That’ll cool you down.”
“No, I can’t do that.”
I don’t have the courage to dress like that.
Please don’t take away the comfort I find in being ordinary.
“Ah… it’s the season when boys stare, huh?”
But Riri-chan seemed to interpret my words differently and said that in a disgusted tone.
I’ve never noticed those kinds of stares.
My flat chest doesn’t attract attention; the vest just hangs loosely.
“I guess I wouldn’t want boys staring at you, Suzuna, considering how slender you are.”
“No, they won’t.”
Who would even look at my body?
They might even complain about being subjected to such an unpleasant sight.
“No, girls would be jealous of your slender figure, Suzuna…”
“They won’t.”
That won’t happen either.
No one is looking at me.
Please don’t compare me to you, the glamorous Riri-chan.
“That only happens to you, Riri-chan.”
“Why?”
“Because you attract attention, unlike me.”
“Hmm, that’s not true… but I do feel like… I’m getting stares even though I don’t make eye contact with the boys…”
Well, that’s what happens when you expose your skin, emphasize your figure, and wear a short skirt.
“I think that’s natural, considering how much skin you’re showing.”
“W-Well, I’m not doing it for the boys…”
“I know, but…”
…Hmm.
Now I’m starting to feel uneasy.
“Then button up your blouse and lengthen your skirt.”
“No way. It’s hot, and it’s not cute.”
She’s being contradictory.
“…You know…”
Hearing her say that made me restless.
I haven’t seen everything about Riri-chan, but…
I’ve seen her in her underwear, and I’ve touched her skin.
I know her scent, the coldness of her fingertips, the warmth of her chest, the taste of her skin, and I’ve even heard the beating of her heart.
I know Riri-chan better than other people.
So I don’t like the thought of other people looking at her with lustful eyes.
“Oh? Could it be, Suzuna, that you don’t like other people looking at my body?”
Riri-chan, as cheeky as ever, grinned teasingly.
“Yeah, I don’t like it.”
“Oh… so that’s how it is.”
Riri-chan seemed taken aback by my straightforward answer, which was probably unexpected.
“That means other people want to touch you, Riri-chan.”
“Ah… well, I guess so.”
Riri-chan, tilting her head as if she hadn’t considered it concretely before, agreed.
“I don’t like that. I don’t want them to touch you, Riri-chan.”
I think I’m the only one who’s allowed to touch Riri-chan.
The thought of others wanting to touch her is unpleasant.
“Suzuna… you don’t usually say what you’re thinking, but sometimes you’re surprisingly straightforward.”
Riri-chan chuckled, looking troubled.
“It’s fine. But you should be careful too, Riri-chan. Don’t just… show off your underwear like that.”
“Ah, yes, I’ll be careful…”
Riri-chan scratched her cheek and replied less confidently than usual, as if giving up.
Maybe she’s just a little tired from the heat.
68 Wounds and Scars: Hinase Riri’s Side
In the morning, as I was changing from my pajamas into my uniform, I happened to glance at myself in the full-length mirror.
My eyes fell on my chest.
My skin looked normal; there was nothing unusual.
Yes, nothing.
“It’s healed.”
I ran my hand over my chest, confirming that my skin was back to normal.
Until recently, there was a painful, red mark there.
The mark from where Suzuna bit me.
Suzuna’s bite, without any holding back, was so painful that I thought she might actually tear my skin.
It was natural for a mark to be left after being bitten that hard, and Suzuna seemed satisfied with it.
“Seriously, what was she thinking?”
But remembering it made me laugh.
Suzuna was so earnest when she bit me.
Suzuna is bad with words and doesn’t like talking about herself, so maybe her emotions overflow at times like those.
I thought it was cute how she desperately tried to convey something to me.
“…Well, it really hurt, so I wish she’d be a little more gentle.”
I put on my blouse, hiding my now unmarked chest.
It’s been a while since she bit me in the music room.
Wounds heal with time.
It’s natural, and I’m glad they do.
She’s bitten both sides, so if the marks remained, I wouldn’t know how to explain them to my friends.
I put on my vest and pulled out the strands of hair that had fallen inside.
…But.
I felt a slight pang of regret.
Because it means losing something Suzuna left behind.
◇◇◇
I went to the living room.
I put on an apron, stood in the kitchen, and started preparing breakfast and lunch.
“…Ah, that’s right, Suzuna said she didn’t need lunch today.”
There was a message on my phone.
It was the first time Suzuna had messaged me, and I was happy.
“Sorry, I can’t go to school with you this morning because of sports festival preparations. And I’ll be busy at lunch, so I don’t need a bento.”
But the content of the message wasn’t so happy.
Suzuna is apparently on the sports committee, a fact she herself seems to have only recently realized.
“‘…Ugh, I’m on the sports committee? No way, seriously, Amatsuki Suzuna… No, wait, maybe this is good for route management…?’”
I vaguely remember her muttering something like that.
And now this sudden message.
It stated what she was doing, but without any details.
It’s typical of Suzuna to suddenly be driven to do something, even though she’s usually quiet and reserved.
I couldn’t help but wonder what she was doing alone.
“Sigh…”
I sighed involuntarily.
I realized that I had become reluctant to prepare lunch just for myself.
I thought about just buying something, but I’ve been telling Suzuna to be more mindful of her diet, so I can’t be careless myself.
I decided to make a proper bento.
“Ouch…”
I accidentally cut my fingertip with the knife.
I make these kinds of mistakes when I’m not focused.
I was surprised at how unenthusiastic I felt about making a bento that wasn’t for Suzuna.
It was just a superficial cut, and the bleeding stopped quickly after rinsing it with water.
There was a thin red line, but it wasn’t noticeable.
Relieved that it wasn’t serious, I continued cooking.
◇◇◇
Lunch break.
A boy from another class asked me to meet him behind the school building, so I went.
He told me, “Come alone, Hinase.”
And I did as he said, but honestly, I had a bad feeling about it.
When I arrived at the meeting place, the boy, acting restless, thanked me for coming and started talking about trivial everyday things.
I didn’t really know him, and his strange behavior made the conversation awkward.
I had experienced this kind of situation several times, so I was expecting him to get to the point soon.
“—Hinase, I’ve liked you for a long time. Please go out with me.”
As expected, my bad feeling was right.
The boy bowed his head, a serious expression on his face.
I could tell he was sincere.
But my answer was already decided.
“Sorry, I can’t… go out with you.”
“…”
I’ve had similar conversations several times before.
I know it hurts to be rejected, but it’s also painful for the one doing the rejecting.
Since he has feelings for me, I don’t want to hurt him if I can help it.
But I can’t lie either.
I think romantic feelings are delicate and fragile.
I avoid interacting with boys as much as possible because I don’t like this awkward atmosphere.
“Well then, I’ll be going.”
Another person I’ll feel awkward talking to at school, I thought, and turned to leave.
“Wait.”
The boy called out to me, and I stopped.
“What?”
“Is there… a reason?”
“A reason…?”
“Do you… have someone you like?”
…Would he be convinced if I told him?
If it would offer him even a little comfort…
Since he worked up the courage to confess, I thought I should respond honestly.
“I do.”
“…I see.”
The boy sighed heavily.
“Sorry for wasting your time.”
“It’s fine, don’t worry about it.”
“Are things going well with him?”
…Are things going well with Suzuna?
I think we’re getting along, but…
Are we in that kind of relationship? I’m not sure.
Normal couples probably don’t bite each other’s chests.
And there are no other lesbian couples around me, so I don’t really know what the standard is.
“I don’t know yet.”
My answer was vague.
“I see… Good luck, Hinase.”
“Yeah, thanks.”
I waved and left.
The cut on my finger was still red.
◇◇◇
“So, Riri, how did it go?”
Back in the classroom, Kaede asked, looking curious.
Since the rumor would spread anyway, I quickly confessed.
“I rejected him.”
“Ahaha, as always.”
My other female friends gathered around.
“How many is that now?”
“That guy is so popular that even upperclassmen confess to him. Rejecting him is impressive.”
My friends chattered excitedly about my love life.
They said things like, “Riri has high standards,” “There’s someone better out there for you,” “Tell us about your past relationships,” “You’re nationally ranked in your club,” and so on.
I don’t know if they’re genuinely concerned about me or if it’s just an excuse to gossip.
But that’s how I spent my lunch break.
Even though the conversation was centered around me, no one mentioned the cut on my finger.
◇◇◇
After school.
I heard that Suzuna’s sports committee duties would end soon, so I decided to wait.
Come to think of it, I haven’t talked to Suzuna all day.
She was busy with the sports committee, so there was no chance to talk.
I want to be with her after school, at least.
I sat in Suzuna’s seat, looking at the sunset through the window.
I remembered a time when Suzuna was feeling down in this classroom, bathed in the same crimson light.
I patted her head that time.
I still remember the feeling of her smooth, black hair and the warmth of her skin.
Suzuna was more introverted back then, and the distance between us was greater.
“…But have we really gotten closer?”
I tried to close the distance, but how much closer have we actually become?
Are we as close as Kaede and I?
Close or distant?
There’s no standard, so it’s impossible to judge.
—Clatter
The classroom door opened.
“Sorry, Riri-chan. It took longer than I expected.”
It was Suzuna.
She seemed slightly out of breath, as if she had rushed.
That alone made me happy.
“No, it’s fine. Good work, Suzuna.”
“Seriously, they dragged on and on about something trivial… hey, Riri-chan, why are you sitting in my seat?”
“Ah, well, I was killing time. This is the best seat for looking at the scenery, isn’t it?”
I pointed at the window.
“Hmm…”
What would she say if I told her I wanted to feel closer to her while waiting?
I don’t have the courage to ask.
“Hey, Riri-chan, what happened to your finger?”
“My finger…?”
Suzuna was staring at the finger I had pointed with.
“You have a cut.”
“Ah, that… I cut myself this morning while making lunch.”
“Whoa, that’s rough.”
It’s just a small cut, the bleeding stopped right away, it’s nothing…
But Suzuna took my hand and looked at my fingertip.
“I don’t have any band-aids… Does it hurt?”
It’s a superficial wound that will heal naturally, so it doesn’t hurt.
“It hurts a little.”
But my mouth said the opposite.
“Hmm. Should we go to the infirmary? Is this an infirmary-worthy injury?”
“No, it’s just a small cut from this morning…”
“Okay, then…”
Suzuna gently stroked my finger, avoiding the cut.
“Pain, pain, go away…”
She chanted a charm I hadn’t heard in a long time.
“Fufu…”
“Eh, why are you laughing?”
I see.
So Suzuna noticed.
More than the boy who confessed his love, more than my worried friends…
Suzuna is worried about this small cut.
“Nothing. You’re so kind, Suzuna.”
“Well, it’s only natural.”
That’s not true.
I’m happy that Suzuna, who says such kindness is “natural,” is here with me.
------------------ 
69 How Long Will You Stay With Me?
“The sports festival is at the end of this month, and Amatsuki is the sports committee member for our class, if I’m not mistaken.”
During homeroom one day, the teacher said something completely unexpected.
“Eh… the sports committee?”
I stared blankly.
“Oh, was I wrong?”
The homeroom teacher hurriedly checked the papers clipped to his clipboard.
“No, that’s right. It’s definitely Amatsuki.”
No way, Amatsuki Suzuna’s character isn’t the sports committee type.
She’s definitely more of a library committee type.
I’m not particularly fond of reading, though.
“…Ugh, I’m on the sports committee? Seriously, Amatsuki Suzuna… no, wait, maybe this is good for route management…?”
“What are you muttering to yourself?”
“Ah, nothing… sorry.”
“The sports committee’s main job is planning and managing the sports festival, so please do your best.”
“…Okay.”
Ah… I don’t want to.
◇◇◇
“Suzuna, you’re on the sports committee?”
Riri-chan asked during lunch break, sounding surprised.
“Apparently.”
“Are you the type who gets fired up for sports festivals?”
“You know the answer to that, don’t you? Do I look like that kind of passionate person?”
“You don’t.”
Riri-chan chuckled wryly at my lack of enthusiasm.
Of course, I’m not motivated at all.
That being said, it’s not all bad.
The sports festival is one of the events in this dating sim where you can get closer to the heroines.
But if I leave things as they are, there’s a high chance that Shindo Minato won’t trigger any flags with any of them.
So it might be beneficial for me to intervene as a sports committee member.
“You have a meeting today, right?”
“Yeah… why are they calling a meeting so late? It’s only three weeks away.”
She’s acting all important even though she didn’t even know she was on the sports committee until just now.
“It’s because they do the same thing every year. Just go with the flow.”
“Okay.”
The real work begins on the day itself.
I’ll just go with the flow for the meetings and preparations.
◇◇◇
“It seems everyone’s here. Then let’s begin the sports festival operations meeting.”
After school, the sports committee was called to the student council room.
Yes… the student council room.
So the one giving instructions was Kanaori Reika herself.
Apparently, the student council, or rather Kanaori-san, is involved in all of Seiran Academy’s school events.
I’m worried she’ll die from overwork.
“That being said, the basic procedures are already set, so we don’t have many agenda items. The main topic is selecting the events, and the rest is mostly confirming the operations and preparations for the day.”
“Well… yes.”
With the capable Kanaori-san in charge, I might be fine just knowing my own responsibilities.
“So let’s decide on the sports festival events today. Once that’s decided, the operations and preparations will naturally fall into place.”
That’s efficient.
“The handouts I’ve just distributed include the results of a survey where we asked all the students for their preferred events. We’ll use that as a basis for our selection.”
Kanaori-san is too efficient.
Everyone just listened intently as Kanaori-san flawlessly led the meeting.
◇◇◇
As the days passed and preparations progressed, my free time, mornings, lunch breaks, and after school, was increasingly occupied.
One day during lunch break…
“Um… I’m supposed to take these poles to the gym storage room.”
I followed instructions and carried the poles.
“—Hinase, I like you. Please go out with me.”
“…?!”
The gym storage room is behind the school building.
In that usually deserted place, I heard a boy’s voice.
The content of his words made me instinctively hide behind a nearby object.
I cautiously peeked out, and there was the back of a boy and Riri-chan facing him.
A confession…
My heart pounded in my chest.
“Sorry, I can’t… go out with you.”
The boy’s shoulders slumped at Riri-chan’s firm rejection.
My heartbeat slowly returned to normal.
…Does that mean… I’m relieved?
Do I really hate the idea of Riri-chan dating someone that much?
I was surprised by my own reaction.
“…Well then, I’ll be going.”
“Wait.”
The boy called out, and Riri-chan stopped.
“What?”
“Is there… a reason?”
“A reason…?”
“Do you… have someone you like?”
Riri-chan does have someone she likes.
But I don’t know who it is.
She jokingly said it was either me or Shindo-kun, and I got angry.
“I do.”
I already knew the answer.
“Are things going well with that person?”
“…”
Riri-chan hesitated for a moment.
“I don’t know yet.”
She had a truly uncertain expression on her face.
Watching her walk away, I felt bewildered.
Hypothetically.
If the person she likes is me, wouldn’t she say things are going well?
We’ve become close, so there’s no reason for her to be unsure.
The poles I was holding suddenly felt heavier.
“So it’s… Shindo-kun…?”
There’s been no progress between her and Shindo-kun.
Then her uncertain answer makes sense.
Will Riri-chan eventually leave me…?
◇◇◇
After school, in the student council room.
The sports festival operations meeting was over.
It was a rare day when I could go home early, so I had made plans with Riri-chan to go home together.
If I went back now, I could leave with Riri-chan while other classmates were still around.
But my feet wouldn’t move.
I felt reluctant, unable to bring myself to stand up from my seat in the student council room.
“Um… Amatsuki-san, the meeting is over.”
Kanaori-san seemed troubled by me staying in the student council room.
“Yes, it is.”
“…So, you should go home.”
“Even if I want to, it’s… difficult to meet her.”
“Are you waiting for someone?”
“Yes, my friend is waiting for me in the classroom.”
“Then all the more reason to hurry, I think…”
“I saw… her being confessed to.”
“…I see.”
Kanaori-san seemed exasperated by me, but she still treated me kindly.
“You seem… shocked.”
“Because your friend… started dating someone?”
“No, she rejected him.”
“…Then there doesn’t seem to be a problem.”
“But if she accepts someone’s confession, she’ll probably stop spending time with me. What do you think about that kind of relationship?”
Kanaori-san put a hand to her mouth, thinking.
“It might be lonely, but perhaps you’re the only one who can be happy for her.”
“…That’s true.”
A beautiful and correct statement.
A very Kanaori-san-like answer.
“But I… can’t do that. I’ll be lonely if she’s not with me.”
I don’t have any other friends, so I’ll be all alone if Riri-chan leaves.
I didn’t mind being alone at first.
But somewhere along the way, I became afraid of being alone.
It’s all Riri-chan’s fault.
“…Then shouldn’t you tell her that?”
“Tell her?”
“Yes, there are no right answers in friendships or romantic relationships. The only thing that matters is how you and your friend want things to be. You have to find the answer together.”
“…Maybe.”
There are no right answers in human relationships.
I know that, and that’s what makes it so difficult.
“But there’s one thing I can say for sure.”
“…What is it?”
“You shouldn’t waste the time you have now, Amatsuki-san.”
“Waste…?”
“Yes, you have a friend who’s waiting for you to go home with her. At least her time is being used for you right now. So why would you be afraid of a loneliness that may or may not come and waste the time you have together?”
“…Well…”
She might be right.
“So, come on, let’s go. I’m sure she’s waiting for you, feeling lonely.”
Kanaori-san’s words resonated with me.
“O-Okay. Thank you, Kanaori-san!”
I left the student council room to see Riri-chan.
70 Don’t Call Me Airheaded
Sports day arrived.
A clear, cloudless sky stretched overhead.
“…I guess most people would consider this perfect weather for sports…”
I don’t, though.
As an introvert, sunny weather is too bright.
“It’s so hot, I’m so tired.”
Riri-chan, sounding languid, came over to where I was taking a break in the shade.
“You too?”
“Of course. Rainy weather would be better than this.”
“Definitely.”
Riri-chan fanned herself with a paper fan.
Her hair was in a ponytail today, suitable for sports, and I could see sweat glistening on the nape of her neck.
“Hey, Suzuna, aren’t you hot in that outfit?”
I was wearing the school-designated navy blue tracksuit, the zipper all the way up.
Riri-chan was wearing a T-shirt with the hem of her tracksuit pants rolled up, revealing quite a bit of skin.
She looked much cooler.
“I am, but… you’ll get sunburned in that outfit.”
“So true. But I can’t help it, it’s too hot. I put on sunscreen, so it should be fine.”
Riri-chan sighed and sat down next to me.
Her T-shirt emphasized her figure more than usual, and my eyes were naturally drawn to her chest.
The bite mark I left was gone.
I felt a little disappointed.
“What are you looking at?”
I was staring too intently.
Riri-chan, noticing my gaze, smiled.
“I was looking at your finger.”
I lied on the spot.
“My finger…?”
“The cut, it’s healed.”
“Yeah, it’s healed. I forgot about it.”
Wounds heal.
Once they heal, they’re forgotten.
Then will Riri-chan also forget the mark I left on her chest once it heals?
Will the memory fade along with the healed skin?
…That’s a little sad.
“So, how’s being on the sports committee?”
After a short silence, Riri-chan filled the void.
“It’s a pain.”
“I know that.”
Riri-chan chuckled; my answer was probably as she expected.
“Suzuna, haven’t you just been carrying things around?”
“It’s part of the setup.”
I’ve been carrying and setting up equipment for the events.
Such an unsuitable task for me.
“Isn’t that usually something the boys do?”
“Yeah, the girls mostly do the guiding and announcements.”
“Then why aren’t you doing that, Suzuna?”
That’s a silly question.
“I don’t have the communication skills for guiding. And I can’t do announcements or speak in front of people.”
“I see, that’s so Suzuna.”
She nodded deeply.
It’s sad that she’s not even denying my shortcomings, even though I’m the one who listed them.
“Are you done with your work?”
“I just have to prepare for the scavenger hunt.”
The scavenger hunt is actually the most important event in this sports festival.
“Is there anything to prepare for that?”
“Just the items for the scavenger list… fufu, I came up with some of them.”
Preparing to ensure the event runs smoothly.
That’s the only reason I’m in charge of the scavenger hunt.
“Riri, you’re up next!”
A classmate called out to Riri-chan from afar.
“It’s already my turn?”
“It’s the relay race next, right?”
“I guess so. I’m not really feeling it, though.”
She stood up, sighing.
“I’ll be cheering for you, so do your best.”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened slightly.
“I see. That’s not bad.”
She said, and then ran towards the field.
◇◇◇
“No way, she’s too fast!”
Riri-chan’s running form was refined and efficient.
Our class was lagging behind considerably, but when Riri-chan started running, she quickly caught up, passing one opponent after another.
She brought us into the lead and passed the baton to the anchor.
It was undoubtedly Riri-chan who turned the race around.
We ended up in second place, but considering we were almost last, it was a great performance.
It was clear who the MVP was, and people gathered around Riri-chan, who was catching her breath.
“You were amazing…”
Riri-chan is talented and charismatic.
She’s not someone who should be hanging out with a gloomy person like me. I was reminded of that once again.
Even so, Riri-chan, pushing through the crowd, gave me a peace sign.
To me, not to the classmates in front of her.
“…Good work.”
I said, waving my hand.
I hope she understood.
◇◇◇
“Hinase, you were amazing out there.”
It was Shindo-kun who spoke to me.
“Yeah, she was.”
I couldn’t help but agree.
“You seem… really happy.”
“…Eh?”
I suddenly felt uncomfortable, like he was seeing through me.
I’ll change the subject.
“You’re in the scavenger hunt, right, Shindo-kun?”
“Yeah, luck-based games don’t require skill.”
The scavenger hunt is about how quickly you can find the items on the list, running speed isn’t that important.
…Wait, the scavenger hunt?
“Ah, I can’t. The scavenger hunt is next, I have to prepare.”
“What? You still have work to do, Suzuna?”
“The sports committee is busy. Everyone’s working hard.”
“I see. Sorry for taking up your time.”
“It’s fine. Don’t worry about me, and do your best in the scavenger hunt, Shindo-kun.”
“Okay.”
I headed towards the field.
◇◇◇
A box was placed in the center of the field, filled with slips of paper with items written on them.
The scavenger hunt is a race to find the person or object that matches the item on the slip of paper and bring them to the finish line.
And I, as a member of the sports committee, prepared those slips of paper.
Kanaori-san was waiting at the finish line to judge whether the items were correct.
In the original story, Shindo-kun draws the item “the person you like.”
It’s an event where his affection value with the heroine he chooses changes significantly.
However, this event only triggers if he has a certain level of intimacy with the heroines. If he doesn’t get along with any of them, it doesn’t happen.
That’s where I come in.
“I endured being on the sports committee for this moment.”
I have the list of participants for the scavenger hunt, so I know the order.
When it’s Shindo-kun’s turn, I’ll replace all the items with “the person you like.”
“And the heroine Shindo-kun chooses will be touched by that.”
Even if their intimacy levels aren’t as high as in the original story, no one would be offended at being chosen as “the person you like.”
This event should increase their intimacy levels, which haven’t been rising until now.
The only concern is that Shindo-kun might choose “Amatsuki Suzuna.”
But I have a countermeasure for that too.
I’m involved in running the scavenger hunt as a sports committee member.
And Shindo-kun knows that. I also made sure to emphasize how busy I am.
So the chances of him choosing me are quite low.
“Yeah, this plan is so perfect, it’s not even like me.”
And finally, it was almost Shindo-kun’s turn.
All I have to do is replace all the items with “the person you like.”
This will finally get the story back on track as a proper dating sim.
I was certain of victory.
“—Ready…”
Bang!
The starting signal.
The students ran and picked a slip of paper from the table in the center of the field.
No matter which one they picked, the item was “the person you like”…!!
“…Huh?”
But I recognized the twintails of the runner who arrived first.
“It’s Kokona-chan…”
And Shindo-kun wasn’t among the runners.
Wait, isn’t that strange?
Why isn’t Shindo-kun here?
And isn’t Kokona-chan coming towards me?
…
What’s going on?
I checked the participant list again.
Among the many names, I found “Shindo.”
“Shindo Kokona.”
“Amatsuki Suzuna! You’re free, right? Help me!”
I completely messed up.
And Kokona-chan, why are you coming to me?
------------------ 
71 Reasons for Acting
“Hey, Amatsuki Suzuna, why are you running away?”
Kokona-chan’s voice, laced with frustration, chased after me.
But I’m the one who wants to complain.
“Why are you chasing after me, Kokona-chan?”
“Because you’re perfect for my item!”
That’s ridiculous.
“There were other people!”
“I’m saying you’re fine.”
“That’s definitely not true!”
“Why are you so sure? You don’t even know what the item is!”
I know.
I’m the one who switched them; it’s “the person you like” for everyone.
As proof, I glanced at the other runners, and they were all hesitating, unsure of who to choose.
“Everyone seems to be having a hard time deciding…?”
Kanaori Reika, the judge, tilted her head, looking puzzled.
“More importantly…”
I have to deal with Kokona-chan now.
I desperately gasped for air and headed towards the shade of the tree where I was resting earlier.
He’s there.
“Shindo-kun!”
“Wh-What is it? Suzuna and Kokona, both of you?”
“Kokona-chan chose you, Shindo-kun, for her scavenger hunt item!”
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
“Wh-What?! Hey, Amatsuki Suzuna, Kokona didn’t say a word about—”
“Eh, what? What’s the item?”
“H-Hey, Onii-chan?!”
Shindo-kun took the slip of paper from Kokona-chan’s hand and checked it.
“‘The person you like’…?”
“So you see, that’s why Onii-chan is—”
“So that’s why!”
“Huh?”
Kokona-chan was taken aback by Shindo-kun’s sudden outburst.
“I thought you were avoiding me lately, but I was wrong!”
“Eh, no, I was definitely avoiding…”
Shindo-kun, overwhelmed with emotion, ignored Kokona-chan’s words and took her arm.
“Okay, let’s go! I’ll show them what sibling love is all about!”
“N-No, wait…!!”
Kokona-chan was dragged along.
As a result, they were the first to reach the finish line.
W-Well, it was a bit forceful, but this should bring him closer to Kokona-chan, the heroine, right?
Now, if only Kanaori-san approves…
“Let me confirm the item.”
“Here.”
Shindo-kun handed her the slip of paper.
Kanaori-san, after checking the item—
“Wh-What is this?!”
Her face flushed red.
“As you can see, it’s ‘the person you like.’”
Kokona-chan seemed disgusted by Shindo-kun’s smug expression.
“H-How… why is this item…? And you two are siblings!”
“Yes, we are.”
“The person you like… you two… that means…”
Ah, Kanaori-san is misunderstanding.
“Yes, precisely because we’re siblings. That’s how true love blossoms.”
Shindo-kun fueled the misunderstanding.
“Th-That…”
“Is there a problem?”
“Of course there is! This is unacceptable!”
Kanaori-san tore the slip of paper to shreds.
◇◇◇
“…Why did you run away, Amatsuki Suzuna?”
In the end, Kokona-chan, deemed disqualified, had to let someone else win.
The heroine’s intimacy level didn’t rise.
And I ended up listening to Kokona-chan’s complaints.
“Because it’s weird for the theme to be ‘the person you like’ and for that person to be me!”
“You’re fine.”
Kokona-chan’s words were firm.
“Well… I understand why you’d want to choose him…”
“Eh… you understood…?”
“I figured it out earlier.”
“S-So that means…”
Kokona-chan gasped.
“Well, ‘the person you like’ could also mean ‘friend,’ depending on how you interpret it, right?”
There are other interpretations of “like” besides romantic love.
This is a game, so there has to be some leeway.
“…Huh?”
“But choosing among friends means prioritizing them, and that could ruin relationships. So choosing me, his childhood friend, is a safe option. It’s convincing since we’ve known each other for so long.”
“Um…”
Kokona-chan seemed to be at a loss for words.
“See? I’m right, aren’t I?”
“…Sigh…”
A long sigh.
“Hmm?”
“That’s right. I thought I could use you since you were convenient.”
Kokona-chan said decisively, as if she had come to a realization.
It seems my deduction was correct.
◇◇◇
It was too early to give up on this sports festival event.
Shindo-kun’s scavenger hunt wasn’t over yet.
I went to the school building to prepare my next move.
“Excuse me.”
I visited the infirmary.
There was a girl lying on the bed.
“Huh… are you feeling unwell too?”
Futaba Yuu, the senpai with short blue hair, seemed surprised by the unexpected visitor.
“It’s not ‘too.’ You’re faking it, aren’t you, Futaba-senpai?”
Yes, this senpai is skipping class because she’s not motivated.
In the original story, she invited Shindo-kun to skip class with her, so I knew she would be here.
“You shouldn’t underestimate mental illness.”
“You’re just unmotivated.”
“Yeah.”
“You’re skipping class.”
“I am.”
Her cheerful, unapologetic attitude was typical of her.
“Then help me.”
“…Eh?”
I woke up the senpai who was lying on the bed.
◇◇◇
“…That should do it.”
This time, it’s really Shindo-kun’s turn.
And I switched the items again.
I can’t use “the person you like” anymore.
I can’t expect any progress with Kanaori-san or Kokona-chan either.
So I prepared a plan to make him choose only Futaba-senpai and raise their intimacy level.
“—Ready…”
Bang! The signal sounded.
Shindo-kun ran and reached the halfway point.
The item I prepared was “your favorite senpai.”
Shindo-kun looked flustered seeing that.
I expected him to be confused since he doesn’t have any close senpais.
That’s where I come in.
I waved at Shindo-kun to get his attention and immediately pointed at Futaba-senpai next to me.
Shindo-kun, understanding my intention, came running towards us.
“Um, Suzuna-chan? Is this… what you meant by helping me…?”
“Yes, please help him.”
“Help…?”
Shindo-kun arrived while she was talking.
“Senpai, would you please…?”
“Um… sure. What’s the item?”
“This.”
He showed her the slip of paper: “Your favorite senpai.”
“Oh my… this is troublesome.”
Futaba-senpai scratched her cheek and looked away.
Is this a good sign…?
With that hope, the two of them headed towards Kanaori-san.
“You again…”
Kanaori-san frowned at Shindo-kun.
“It’ll be fine this time.”
Shindo-kun handed her the slip of paper.
“I see… your favorite senpai.”
“We pass, right?”
“Then I have a few questions.”
“Questions?”
“Yes, to confirm.”
“I see…”
“Then please tell me Futaba-senpai’s future plans.”
“Future plans…?”
“Yes, if she’s your favorite senpai, you should know. Even I know.”
Ah… so that’s how she’s confirming it.
“…Getting a job?”
Shindo-kun took a gamble.
“She’s going to college. Right, Futaba-senpai?”
“Ah, yeah.”
“Oops, that’s right. Of course I knew that.”
He got it wrong, but he’s still clinging to the idea.
And Seiran Academy is a preparatory school, so it’s natural to choose college.
“You knew that?”
“Yes, of course. I was just testing you, President.”
Testing her from what position?
“I see. Then please tell me the name of the university Futaba-senpai is planning to attend.”
“…”
“You don’t know?”
An unsettling air flowed between the protagonist and the heroine.
◇◇◇
“It seems I wasn’t helpful.”
Futaba-senpai reported the results.
The heroine’s intimacy level wouldn’t rise no matter what.
“…Sorry. I appreciate you helping me.”
Is it really impossible to trigger the event without an established relationship?
“I don’t mind. More importantly, Suzuna-chan, why did you want Shindo-kun to win the scavenger hunt? You even went so far as to switch the items.”
“…That’s because…”
Futaba-senpai saw through my scheme.
“I wanted Shindo-kun and Futaba-senpai to get along.”
“Is that all?”
“That’s all.”
“You don’t have any personal stake in this?”
“Me?”
“Yeah, it’s not normal to go to such lengths for someone else. Don’t you have some kind of wish?”
“…If he gets a girlfriend, I’ll be free.”
Then I can avoid the ending with him.
That’s my wish.
“Really?”
“Why are you so suspicious?”
“I feel like there’s more.”
“What else could there be?”
I’d like to know if there is.
“Well, for example… you’re trying to separate Shindo-kun from someone by pairing him with me.”
My heart pounded.
“…What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Getting closer to someone means distancing yourself from someone else.”
Hearing those words, I thought of Riri-chan.
If I pair Shindo-kun with another heroine, the possibility of him ending up with Riri-chan disappears.
Is that why I’ve been so proactive, because I wanted that?
72 Learning What You Don’t Know
“Nothing is going right…”
Having finished my sports committee duties, I took a break in the shade of a tree at the edge of the field.
Feeling discouraged, I sat hunched over, my face buried in my knees.
The loud commentary and excited cheers from the crowd echoed through the speakers.
I felt terribly out of place amidst all the excitement.
In the end, no matter what I did, Shindo-kun’s intimacy level with the heroines didn’t increase.
Moreover, Futaba-senpai pointed out that my motivation stemmed from Riri-chan.
“What does that even mean…?”
I thought I was acting because I didn’t want to be alone, but I was surprised to realize it was the driving force behind my actions.
What do I even want?
I don’t understand myself.
“Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s voice called out from afar.
The sound of her footsteps approached, and before I knew it, she was sitting next to me.
“…”
“Are you… tired from all the work?”
“…Various things.”
“You seem down.”
“I’m always like this.”
“You’re more down than usual. What happened?”
It’s hard to explain…
How long will I have to live in fear of the Shindo-kun ending, unable to tell anyone the truth?
“You were interacting with a lot of people during the scavenger hunt and all. Is it related to that?”
“…You were watching?”
That would mean Riri-chan, who usually comments on everything, was silently observing.
That’s unusual.
“I was cheering for you, thinking you were working hard, Suzuna.”
“Ah, that’s why. …Thank you.”
She was being considerate.
But I don’t feel good about it, since I wasn’t working hard out of genuine dedication.
“So what happened?”
“…”
“If you don’t tell me, I’ll take a picture of you and post it on social media.”
“…What’s with that threat?”
“You don’t like that kind of thing, do you?”
“I don’t.”
It’s digital tattooing.
“Then tell me.”
“I can’t end this unless I tell you…?”
“Of course, sharing is what friends are for.”
Is that so…?
No, wait. It’s strange to threaten someone to share their problems…
But if I don’t tell her, she might actually post a picture of unattractive me online.
I don’t want people all over the world to have their eyes polluted by my appearance.
“…It’s about Shindo-kun.”
I felt hesitant bringing up Shindo-kun’s name in front of Riri-chan, considering everything.
“Your childhood friend, Shindo.”
But Riri-chan’s unexpectedly normal reaction made me feel a little better.
“Yeah. I want Shindo-kun to start dating someone.”
“…You were thinking about that?”
If Riri-chan likes Shindo-kun, that wouldn’t be a pleasant thing for her to hear.
“Is that strange?”
“I don’t think that’s something you’d do for someone you used to like.”
It was Amatsuki Suzuna who liked Shindo, not me, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
But a part of me doesn’t want to see Riri-chan talk about Shindo-kun.
But I can’t avoid this conversation any longer.
“…That’s true. But I, the real Yukitsuki Mashiro, didn’t have those kinds of feelings for him. That’s why I can try to set him up with someone.”
I thought that would lead to happiness for him and the heroines in this game, and for me personally.
“So you thought you liked him, but you actually didn’t?”
“Something like that.”
Riri-chan gave a noncommittal “hmm.”
“And your efforts failed miserably.”
“…They did.”
“I don’t understand. Why are you trying so hard for someone else, Suzuna?”
“That’s because…”
It’s to avoid the ending with him… and to keep Shindo-kun away from Riri-chan.
But I can’t say that.
“I don’t think that will work.”
“…Eh?”
Riri-chan’s tone was firm.
“Because you don’t have any feelings for Shindo anymore, right?”
“That’s true, but…”
“Trying to set someone up with someone else when you don’t even like them… that’s not going to work.”
“Is that so…?”
“It is. You have to believe someone is appealing to convey that to the other person. No one would believe your recommendation if you don’t feel anything yourself.”
…She might be right.
I thought it would work because he’s the protagonist and they’re the heroines.
So I thought they’d eventually end up together as long as there was a trigger, regardless of their feelings…
“If you try to convey something without any feeling, what gets conveyed is the lack of feeling.”
That’s right.
The irregularities started with Amatsuki Suzuna’s existence itself.
She, who was more devoted to Shindo-kun than anyone, completely lost interest in him after becoming Yukitsuki Mashiro.
Maybe I was wrong to expect the other heroines to follow the original story’s development when such a drastic change occurred.
Change is contagious.
Since I changed, it’s natural for others to change as well.
“I’m going to pry a little further, but… Suzuna… do you… like anyone right now?”
Riri-chan asked hesitantly.
“Me? Like someone…?”
“Yeah, I was wondering…”
Liking someone, loving someone…
I know those feelings exist.
But if you ask if I, Yukitsuki Mashiro, have ever experienced them, the answer is different.
“…I don’t think so.”
I’ve never thought, “I like this person,” or “I love this person.”
“…I see.”
Riri-chan’s voice was heavy with unspoken words.
“Then isn’t it difficult to make other people fall in love?”
Riri-chan saw through me.
She pointed out that’s why my efforts failed.
“…That’s true.”
“That’s why you should focus on your own feelings, Suzuna, rather than other people’s.”
“My feelings?”
“Yeah, anything. Like… love, for example.”
That might be the emotion I lack the most.
And I realized why I don’t understand it.
It’s because of what Riri-chan told me.
“If you try to convey something without any feeling, what gets conveyed is the lack of feeling.”
Feelings are transmitted through people.
Then when will someone who hasn’t been shown those feelings, like love, ever understand them?
“Suzuna…?”
“Because I’ve always been alone? How can I know what love is like?”
This isn’t about Amatsuki Suzuna, it’s about me, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
My parents never said “good night” to me, never whispered “I love you.”
I was raised out of obligation.
I always wondered how my parents felt about me.
“They don’t care about me at all.”
When I came to that conclusion, I closed off my heart.
I hid the empty, hollow me.
So I was wrong to seek a place in this world from the beginning.
I finally understood that.
…And yet.
“I see. So you’re the same as me, Suzuna.”
Ignoring my conclusion, I felt a warm touch on my cheek.
It was Riri-chan’s hand.
“Eh…”
I was pulled into her embrace.
My gaze, which had been fixed on my knees, now rested on Riri-chan’s chest.
Her sweet fragrance surrounded me.
“I understand how you feel, Suzuna. I was alone too.”
“You too…?”
Come to think of it, Riri-chan’s house was strangely sterile, except for her room.
A house devoid of human warmth.
Her parents live elsewhere, leaving her alone in a luxurious, empty house.
“Yeah, but it’s okay. You’ll understand someday.”
“Really…?”
“Because I did. There’s no way you won’t understand too, Suzuna.”
Is that true?
I don’t have any basis for believing that.
But I, the weak and hesitant me, don’t have the courage or the resolve to deny her words.
------------------ 
73 The Empty Me
“…Riri-chan, what is this?”
“What do you mean? I’m just comforting you.”
Riri-chan was letting me use her lap as a pillow, and she was even stroking my head.
Fortunately, we were hidden in a secluded spot, so I don’t think anyone saw us, but…
“I’m asking why you’re doing this.”
“I’m just rewarding you for your hard work, Suzuna.”
“I’m worried someone might see us.”
“But you’re not resisting.”
“Well… that’s true.”
I don’t dislike having Riri-chan as my pillow or having my head stroked by her.
Riri-chan’s body is soft, and her touch is gentle.
“Hey, Suzuna… what kind of person were you… in the past?”
She suddenly asked that.
“My past…?”
“Yeah, we only met recently, right? So I don’t know anything about your childhood or anything.”
“…It’s not very interesting.”
Because I’m a boring person.
I don’t think there’s any point in listening to someone like that’s story.
“Your story is interesting to me, Suzuna.”
“…Are you looking for a laugh?”
“That’s not what I mean.”
She wasn’t giving me a chance to escape.
Which “me” is she asking about? Amatsuki Suzuna or Yukitsuki Mashiro?
…Yukitsuki Mashiro, I guess.
I pondered where to begin and sighed before quietly starting my story.
◇◇◇
“Mashiro-chan seems so uninterested in everything, it’s like she’s boring.”
That was something I heard often, regardless of the person’s gender.
For example, conversations about classmates, music, the internet, TV, sports.
It didn’t matter what it was, I was indifferent to everything and never shared common interests with anyone.
So I couldn’t understand why everyone was so enthusiastic about gossiping.
“Yeah, I’m not interested.”
But I didn’t think it was a bad thing when I was younger.
Because I knew people who were just like me.
◇◇◇
“Mom, here.”
I handed my tests and assignments to my mother.
My mother took them silently and looked them over.
“Good work.”
That was all.
Whether the results were good or bad, her response was always the same.
The conversation ended with her flat voice and businesslike remark.
My father was often away from home on business trips, and I barely have any memories of talking to him.
Even when he occasionally came home and we talked—
“I see. Okay.”
—That was his only response.
But I never thought this was strange.
This was normal to me; it was the reactions of the outside world that were abnormal.
Since my parents are indifferent, it’s only natural that I’m also indifferent.
It was a natural consequence, and I never felt any discomfort.
I grew up like that.
◇◇◇
“Yukitsuki, have you thought about what you want to do after graduation?”
At the age of fifteen, having done nothing in particular with my life, I must have been a headache for my homeroom teacher.
“Not really, I don’t care.”
I wasn’t interested.
My grades were average, neither good nor bad.
I didn’t feel like making any more effort, nor did I feel like slacking off.
So I knew roughly what kind of schools I could get into.
Once high school was decided, I could see the future that awaited me.
Since it was an ordinary high school, a life as an ordinary person awaited me, whether I went to college or got a job.
I could imagine the mundane future, and I wasn’t interested.
“You don’t care? Do you have any specific aspirations?”
“I’ll go wherever I get in.”
The teacher scratched his cheek, looking troubled.
“Have you discussed this with your parents?”
We were in the career counseling room, where parent-teacher-student meetings were usually held.
But it was just me and the teacher.
The answer was obvious.
“They said I can do what I want.”
“…Is that so?”
That’s a lie.
They didn’t say anything.
◇◇◇
I went to high school.
I didn’t have any close friends, but I accepted that.
I guess it’s better to have friends, but it was difficult for me.
I’m not good at… liking someone.
Because I lacked those kinds of emotions.
“Hey, Yukitsuki-san, why are you always alone?”
“She likes being alone.”
“She’s always quiet, it’s creepy.”
“I don’t know what she’s thinking.”
Even I felt downhearted hearing those whispers, knowing they were talking about me.
I don’t mind being alone, but I don’t like being ridiculed for it.
I can’t stay the same as when I was a child forever.
Having gradually learned some social skills, I became tired of the stares from those around me.
That’s when I started watching manga and anime.
The characters seemed to be full of emotions.
Fighting, becoming friends, falling in love.
They seemed to express the emotions I lacked to the fullest.
I thought maybe I could gain something by watching something born from emptiness, since I myself was empty.
And after playing the dating sim “My Girlfriend Next Door Is Super Sweet,” I realized…
I don’t understand the characters’ emotions.
Concluding that it was because I’m an apathetic person, I stopped caring about everything.
◇◇◇
“…See? It’s a boring story, isn’t it?”
I gave a rough summary of Yukitsuki Mashiro’s life.
Even looking back on it myself, it was completely uninteresting.
If someone told me to give them back their time, I’d apologize sincerely.
“No, no, it was very interesting.”
“…Seriously?”
“Seriously, seriously.”
Is this really interesting? Has Riri-chan never heard anyone else’s life story before?
Her reaction was so strange that I started to doubt such an impossible thing.
“So, like you said earlier, Riri-chan, love is impossible for me.”
That’s why I don’t know what to do about Shindo-kun or the heroines.
I’ve completely given up.
“It’s okay. You have a heart, Suzuna. You’ll understand love soon.”
She’s saying such carefree things after just making me realize the harsh truth.
I know it’s not her fault, but I don’t want her to say such irresponsible things either.
“But I’ve lived my life without being able to understand it. It’s impossible for me anymore.”
I’m hollow, empty, and lacking.
“Seriously…”
“Ouch!”
She cupped my face in her hands.
My vision shifted upwards as she made me look at her. I was using her lap as a pillow.
Riri-chan lowered her face closer to mine.
Our foreheads almost touched.
“I’m proof of that.”
“Proof of what, Riri-chan…?”
“Proof that you can change, Suzuna.”
“Huh…?”
What is this, a riddle?
I’m not good with that kind of mental gymnastics, so please spare me.
“You didn’t have any friends, right?”
“That’s true, but…”
Is she the type who likes rubbing salt in the wound by confirming sad facts?
“What about me?”
“…Riri-chan.”
“No, I mean, in terms of… position?”
“…Friend.”
Then what is she trying to say?
“See? You’ve changed. You learned something new, and you even complained to Kaede, didn’t you? Isn’t that because you learned what it means to like someone, to have a friend?”
“…”
That might be true.
“See? You’ll be fine, Suzuna.”
“…I wonder.”
“Yeah, it’s just that no one happened to teach you.”
If emotions are transmitted through people, then…
“But I’m here now, so it’s okay. I’ll teach you, Suzuna.”
Maybe I can learn from Riri-chan.
After all, she’s the one who’s always filled the emptiness within me.
74 Things You Like
It was nearing the end of June.
The sports festival was over, freeing me from committee activities, and my daily life returned to normal.
Though the scorching hot days were getting to me.
“Suzuna, are you free after school today?”
Riri-chan asked during lunch break while we were eating together.
“I am.”
“Then come shopping with me.”
Shopping… We went to the downtown area before for shopping.
I remember being flustered, buying unfamiliar casual clothes.
“Kanaori will get mad if we’re seen shopping in our uniforms.”
Riri-chan’s expression turned sullen at the mention of her name.
“I don’t care what that girl says. It’s not like we’re committing a crime.”
“Those are the words of the student council president.”
“I don’t acknowledge her.”
“…Are you against democracy?”
“That’s not what I mean!”
“…Do you have a problem with the election system?”
“Suzuna, stop making the conversation so difficult!”
I was scolded.
“So, are you coming or not?”
She pressed me intensely.
I’m happy that Riri-chan invited me.
But I feel bad about ignoring the student council president’s words.
If I refuse, I might upset Riri-chan.
I nodded.
“I’m coming.”
“Good girl.”
Riri-chan’s mood immediately brightened.
◇◇◇
After school.
We walked through the downtown area together.
The streets were crowded with people leaving work and school, creating a bustling atmosphere.
I still don’t like these kinds of crowds.
“Here.”
Riri-chan suddenly held out her hand.
What’s this?
There’s no treat in her palm.
“You looked restless, Suzuna. You’ll feel better if we hold hands.”
“Ah, okay…”
Riri-chan is quick to pick up on my subtle cues, even though I didn’t say anything.
And she does this kind of thing without hesitation, it’s reassuring.
I took Riri-chan’s hand.
“Alright, let’s go.”
She walked ahead of me.
I’ve witnessed this scene many times.
Riri-chan walks in front, guiding me.
I always rely on her.
We arrived at the same general store in the building we visited before.
“This is it?”
Seeing the store brought back some unpleasant memories.
“Yeah, is something wrong?”
“…No, nothing.”
Riri-chan was looking at stuffed animals in this store, wondering which one to get for Tachibana-san’s birthday.
I got incredibly upset and left the store without saying anything.
We made up afterward, but seeing the store again brought back vivid memories of that time.
But that’s in the past; it has nothing to do with us now.
I’m just overthinking it.
I calmed myself and entered the store.
My eyes were immediately drawn to the stuffed animal corner.
“You really do like stuffed animals, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan, noticing my gaze, commented.
I do like stuffed animals, but that’s not the only reason I was looking.
“You were here before, looking at stuffed animals and wondering what to get for Tachibana-san’s present, right?”
“Ah, yeah, I was.”
Riri-chan also remembered and looked a little awkward.
“So what did you get her?”
“Ah, that… what was it again…? I didn’t buy anything here in the end. I think I gave her something like… aromatherapy stuff.”
“I see.”
Hearing that made me feel a little relieved.
I didn’t want her to give Tachibana-san something that both Riri-chan and I found cute.
“You’re not… angry about that, are you…?”
Riri-chan seemed a little nervous, as if she had stepped on a landmine.
It seems like I’m making her worry.
“I’m not. I understand, so it’s fine.”
“R-Right.”
But I might have been upset if she had given her a stuffed animal.
I looked at the stuffed animals again.
“…”
“Suzuna, do you like this kind of thing?”
Riri-chan picked up a stuffed animal from the corner I was looking at.
“…Kind of.”
It was a penguin stuffed animal.
But its face and body were too round, and its limbs were disproportionately short.
The only way you could tell it was a penguin was from its blue and white coloring; otherwise, it would have been an unidentified creature.
“…Isn’t it a bit… underwhelming?”
“I like that… indescribable quality.”
“Ah, I see…”
It seems it didn’t suit Riri-chan’s taste.
“Which one do you like better?”
Riri-chan picked up another penguin.
A gray and white version.
Those were the only two penguin stuffed animals.
“Both.”
“Eh, really…? Even though they’re different colors?”
“Well, it would be sad to leave one behind.”
“Sad…?”
“It would be sad if one of them was left alone when they’re a pair.”
“…I see.”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened, and she looked back and forth between the two penguins in her hands.
Seeing her reaction, I started to worry that I had said something strange again.
“Um, is that weird?”
“No, it’s cute.”
“Cute…?”
The penguins are cute, but…
“It’s cute how much you care about stuffed animals, Suzuna, and how you think it would be lonely for one of them to be left alone.”
“Ah, you mean… me…”
She was talking about me.
“But you can say that while holding such cute things in both hands?”
I think my cuteness is microscopic compared to these two penguins.
“Hmm… are these really that cute…?”
Riri-chan still doesn’t seem to understand.
◇◇◇
In the end, Riri-chan didn’t buy anything.
Apparently, while there were things she wanted, she could buy them another time.
I see, I thought as we left the building.
“Then I guess we’ll part ways here.”
Riri-chan’s house, located in the city, is only a few minutes’ walk from here.
It was natural for us to go our separate ways.
But I couldn’t bring myself to agree.
“…I’ll walk you home.”
“Eh, what’s with the sudden change of heart?”
“It’s just…”
I thought it would be lonely to part ways, that’s all.
But it’s embarrassing to say that out loud.
“You always walk me home when I leave your house, Riri-chan. It’s the same thing.”
“…Okay, if you insist, Suzuna.”
During the sports festival, Riri-chan said I’d understand what it means to like someone.
That I’d learn about friendship through her.
I wonder if I can convey my feelings to her, precisely because she has someone she likes.
But thinking about it made me feel down.
“Hey, Suzuna, you’ve stopped. Aren’t you walking me home?”
“Ah, sorry…”
The person Riri-chan likes…
If she starts dating them, she won’t be able to spend time with me like this anymore.
That’s unavoidable, but is it wrong of me to feel sad about it?
So I pray that day never comes.
I deliberately slowed my pace, wanting to spend even a little more time with Riri-chan.
------------------ 
75 Celebration
It was nearing the end of June.
The rainy season had settled in, and the days were filled with dreary rain.
Listless days drifted by.
In the morning, I headed to our usual meeting spot to go to school with Riri-chan.
“Suzuna-saaan, you’re free today, right?”
Riri-chan’s voice was unusually bright and cheerful.
A stark contrast to me, feeling gloomy along with the rainy weather.
“I’m free.”
Or rather, my schedule is always free.
“Ehehe… so what are we doing today? Your house?”
“Eh, yeah… my house is fine…”
“Hey, Suzuna, why are you so down? Do you even know what day it is today?”
“I… have a feeling…”
It’s June 24th.
I have a hunch, but I don’t have the courage to say it out loud.
I want Riri-chan to be the one to say it…
“It’s your birthday, Suzuna! You didn’t forget, did you?”
“Ah, no, I remember.”
I do remember my own birthday, at least.
But I wasn’t sure if Riri-chan was actually planning to celebrate, so I was hesitant.
I didn’t want to create an awkward atmosphere by asking for a celebration when she wasn’t planning one.
“Then I’ll go home after school and then head to your place. See you later.”
“Ah, okay. See you later…”
Riri-chan was unusually high-spirited.
I’m happy that she’s celebrating my birthday, but I don’t think it’s something to be so excited about.
“Alright, even though school is boring, I can do this for your birthday, right?”
“Ah, yeah.”
“You can do it, right?”
For some reason, she was demanding confirmation.
“I can do it…”
“Alright, let’s go to school!”
Do I have to be this energetic when celebrating Riri-chan’s birthday?
…I don’t think I can.
I really want to celebrate, but I don’t think I can match her energy level.
I headed to school, feeling strangely energized.
◇◇◇
Before I knew it, it was the end of the school day.
I felt restless all day today.
“Suzuna, school’s over!”
“Ah, yeah…”
As soon as homeroom ended, Riri-chan rushed to my desk.
“Let’s go home.”
“Th-That was fast…”
Her eagerness is overwhelming.
“There’s no point in staying at school any longer. It’s a waste of time.”
“Y-Yeah.”
Urged by Riri-chan’s “Hurry up, hurry up,” we left school earlier than anyone else.
◇◇◇
So, after parting ways with Riri-chan in the downtown area, I went home first.
But waiting is so tedious…
“Wh-What should I do…?”
I thought my uniform might be inappropriate, so I decided to change.
Since it was hot and humid even though it was the rainy season, I changed into a T-shirt and track pants.
W-Well… it’s loungewear, so it’s fine, right?
But changing clothes didn’t take long.
I fidgeted restlessly, sitting on the sofa and pacing around the living room.
The clock seemed to move slower than usual.
◇◇◇
Thirty minutes, which felt like an eternity, passed.
—Ding-dong
The doorbell rang, and I rushed to the entrance.
I opened the door.
“W-Welcome…”
“Suzuna, I’m here!”
Riri-chan, beaming, stood at the entrance.
She was wearing an oversized white T-shirt and black denim shorts, with a large tote bag on her shoulder.
Ah, this is bad…
Even though it’s a simple outfit, Riri-chan still looks stylish.
She’s wearing a necklace, and her T-shirt is neatly tucked in…
I messed up, I let my guard down.
I shouldn’t have gone full loungewear mode just because I’m at home.
“Come in.”
“Yay, it’s been a while!”
But Riri-chan didn’t seem to mind and entered the living room.
She seemed genuinely excited.
“Can I use the kitchen?”
Her eyes sparkled.
But… the kitchen…?
“What are you doing?”
“You haven’t eaten yet, have you?”
“Well, not yet, but…”
I just got home.
“Fufu, so I’m making you dinner.”
She said, and then took out an apron from her tote bag and put it on.
She also took out ingredients and seasonings. I realized that’s why she had such a large bag.
“Eh, are you sure…?”
“Of course!”
“I-I can help…”
“What are you saying? The birthday girl should relax and wait.”
I-Is that so…?
Riri-chan efficiently started cooking.
◇◇◇
“Alright, it’s done!”
A short while later, sandwiches, hamburger steak, teriyaki chicken, salad, and tomato soup were lined up on the table.
“Th-This is amazing…”
I always eat Riri-chan’s cooking, but this is on a different level.
Just looking at the dishes made my mouth water.
“Ehehe… and of course, I also have this.”
“This…?”
Riri-chan took out a white box from her tote bag.
A whole strawberry cake appeared.
“A cake is essential for a birthday, right?”
“D-Did you…?”
“Hmm?”
“Did you make this?”
“Of course!”
“S-Seriously…”
This is… too much. I’m speechless…
I felt overwhelmed by such a wonderful spread.
“Come on, eat, eat!”
“Ah, okay…”
Urged by Riri-chan, we sat down at the dining table.
“Here you go.”
Riri-chan’s eyes sparkled as she looked at me.
“Thank you…”
I should probably start with the hamburger steak, the main dish.
I picked up a knife and fork.
The meat was so tender that I could tell just from cutting it.
With each bite, the juices overflowed, and the demi-glace sauce had just the right flavor.
“S-So… how is it…?”
I put down my knife and fork and held my head in my hands.
“Eh, is it not good?”
“It’s… too delicious…”
I was speechless.
Not that I was planning on complaining.
“Seriously?”
“Seriously.”
The same thing happened when she made me pasta before.
This is the same.
“If you keep making this for me, I won’t be able to eat microwaved hamburger steak anymore…”
Or rather, it’s so good that I wonder if it’s even the same dish.
It’s like they share the same name but are completely different things.
“Ehehe… eat, eat!”
“Ah, okay…”
Everything Riri-chan makes is delicious.
There’s nothing to complain about.
But as I continued eating, I realized…
“I… I might be full…”
There’s too much food.
I’m a light eater, so I couldn’t finish all the dishes spread out on the table.
I probably haven’t even eaten a third.
“Ah, it’s okay. Don’t force yourself. I’ll eat the rest.”
Riri-chan had been watching me eat.
Even so…
“Can you eat all of this?”
I wondered if she could really finish it all.
“…I can.”
Riri-chan muttered shyly.
◇◇◇
Riri-chan really did finish all the leftovers.
It was satisfying to watch her eat so heartily.
“Thank you, Riri-chan. It was delicious.”
“I’m glad.”
Riri-chan beamed.
She’s smiling so brightly just from my thanks.
“Ah, wait, I almost forgot something important…”
Riri-chan rummaged through her tote bag as if she just remembered.
…Just how much stuff is in that bag?
“Here.”
She handed me a paper bag.
It seemed to contain something.
“…Can I open it?”
“Yeah, open it.”
I rustled open the bag, and the contents were familiar.
“Penguins…”
“Happy birthday, Suzuna.”
It was the same ones we saw at the general store the other day.
Both the gray and white and the blue and white ones.
A complete pair.
“I was wondering which one to get… You reacted the most to these penguins, Suzuna, so I got them. Are they okay?”
So that’s why she didn’t buy anything that day…
“Yeah, I’m happy. Thank you…”
I hugged the two penguins to my chest.
“They’re so cute!”
“Yeah, they are.”
I stroked the penguin’s head.
“No, you’re cute, Suzuna.”
I feel like we had this conversation before.
“Thank you… for everything…”
I’m truly happy.
But I don’t think I can repay her kindness.
“No, it’s fine. I’m happy that you’re happy, Suzuna.”
“Is that all it takes…?”
“Yeah, it’s the best.”
Is that why Riri-chan was so cheerful and energetic since this morning?
“It’s not a big deal, it’s just my birthday.”
“No, it’s special to me. I’m happy.”
“Why?”
“Because I’m the only one who can celebrate with you in this world, Suzuna. How can I not be happy about that?”
“That’s not a big dea—”
Or rather, it’s just because no one else wants to celebrate with me that I’m left alone with you. It’s not that special…
“There’s still cake. There’s always room for dessert, right?”
“Ah, okay…”
I don’t really have a separate stomach for dessert…
But my heart is full from the happiness of being celebrated by Riri-chan.
76 Unease
Time flew by at Riri-chan’s birthday celebration.
Before I knew it, it was late at night, and Riri-chan stood up, saying, “I should probably go home soon.”
The fun times quickly came to an end, and I felt a pang of loneliness at the thought of Riri-chan leaving.
“Good night, Suzuna.”
“Good night.”
I waved goodbye to Riri-chan at the entrance.
After she was out of sight, I closed the door and returned to the living room.
Riri-chan’s presence lingered, even though she was gone. It felt strange.
I wonder if she feels this way when I leave her house.
But Riri-chan probably has lots of friends to hang out with, so she might not feel that way.
The penguins were sitting on the dining table chairs.
The present Riri-chan gave me.
I picked them up.
“Shall we go together?”
Since they’ve only seen the living room, I decided to take them to my room.
I wondered where to put them and tried placing them on a shelf.
“…This isn’t right.”
I have a feeling I’ll be touching them frequently, so I want them somewhere more accessible.
Then I saw the bed. This might be a good spot.
I placed the penguins on the bed and covered them with the blanket.
“…Cute.”
They looked so comfortable.
I wanted to lie down with them.
I got ready for bed, turned off the lights, and lay down.
I moved slightly to the right, leaving the left side for the penguins.
I usually sleep alone, but from today onwards, these little ones will sleep with me.
“Nice to meet you.”
I wonder how much time I’ll spend with them.
I want to treasure them since they’re from Riri-chan.
◇◇◇
School gradually shifted towards preparations for the cultural festival in July.
The sports festival just ended, and now this. Students are so busy.
The cultural festival is also an important event in this dating sim, crucial for developing relationships between the protagonist and the heroines.
But I don’t have the energy to think about that right now.
I realized that I, who can’t even understand my own feelings, am in no position to manage other people’s romantic relationships.
“Suzuna, isn’t our class’s project terrible?”
One day during lunch break, Riri-chan was in a bad mood.
“Ah, well, it’s a classic, isn’t it? A maid cafe.”
Our class decided on a typical project.
And I know how it happened.
“Apparently, I’m going to be serving customers as a maid, no questions asked. Don’t I have a say in this?”
“Well… you’re… popular.”
Our class has Hinase Riri, the most popular girl in school.
If they want to attract customers using her beauty, a maid cafe is a good choice.
“I don’t want to do it…”
But Riri-chan, the person in question, was the most opposed.
It’s rare for her to complain this much.
“You hate it that much?”
“Well, I’ll probably be stared at, and I’m not good at that kind of thing.”
“Ah, is that so?”
“Why do you sound so surprised?”
“I thought you wouldn’t mind, since it happens to you all the time.”
“I hate it! I can’t handle it!”
Well, that’s true…
No one likes being stared at by strangers.
“Well, I wouldn’t mind showing you, Suzuna.”
Then she suddenly looked at me with a confident expression.
I wasn’t sure if she was joking or not.
◇◇◇
Preparations for the cultural festival gradually progressed.
Once the general roles were decided, we moved on to more detailed tasks.
“Amatsuki-san, would you be in charge of the cooking?”
The leader of the cooking team asked.
It’s not good to refuse after they specifically asked me.
I nodded obediently.
“Okay.”
“Great! Then…”
The conversation ended quickly, and the leader was about to move on to assigning tasks to other people when—
“Wait a minute!”
Riri-chan barged in.
She’s on the maid team, so she shouldn’t be involved in this discussion.
“Wh-What is it, Hinase-san…?”
The people in charge of cooking are mostly quiet and reserved.
The more outgoing students are on the maid team.
For better or worse, there’s a clear divide between the cooking team and the maid team.
Everyone was intimidated by being directly addressed by Riri-chan, the most glamorous among them.
It’s strange that I’m the one who can talk to her normally.
“I think Suzuna would be better suited for the… preliminary stages.”
“The preliminary stages? You mean… planning the menu or procuring the ingredients?”
“Exactly.”
Apparently, Riri-chan didn’t want me to cook.
She argued vehemently, and the cooking team leader nodded repeatedly.
“O-Okay… we’ll ask Amatsuki-san to do that.”
So I was indirectly told I was unfit for cooking and was put in charge of planning the menu and procuring the ingredients.
◇◇◇
Once the menu was decided, the ingredients and cooking methods were naturally determined.
My role was to purchase the ingredients, figure out how much we could make with them, and calculate the selling price to ensure profitability.
It was a perfect, unassuming behind-the-scenes task, suitable for me.
The boys in our class were mostly on the decoration team, decorating the classroom to look like a cafe.
I was in a corner of the noisy classroom, working on the calculations with a calculator.
“Hmm, it’s cuter than I expected.”
Tachibana-san’s voice.
The maid team had gathered in the center of the classroom.
Apparently, the maid outfits had arrived, and they were checking them out.
“Ugh… I have to wear this…”
Riri-chan, as always, looked disgusted.
“Riri, why don’t you try it on?”
Tachibana-san suggested, completely unfazed.
“Why me?”
“I think everyone wants to see you in it.”
The other girls nodded in agreement.
Even the boys, who were supposed to be decorating, stopped working.
You should be working, boys.
…But I’m not the type to say that, so I kept quiet.
“It’s fine, I’ll do it later.”
“What if the size doesn’t fit?”
Riri-chan tried to refuse, but Tachibana-san pressed on.
The others also seemed to be on Tachibana-san’s side, and the atmosphere in the class shifted towards making Riri-chan try it on.
I can’t watch this.
I stood up and left the classroom.
◇◇◇
The hallway was also crowded with people and materials for each class’s preparations.
I walked silently towards the back of the school amidst the noisy atmosphere.
Why couldn’t I bear to watch?
It’s natural for Riri-chan to be the center of attention.
And this is just the preparation stage.
Even more people will come to see Riri-chan once the actual festival starts.
I knew that, but the scene from earlier made it feel so real, and I felt disgusted.
“—Hinase, I like you. Please go out with me.”
I remembered the boy who confessed to Riri-chan during the sports festival.
Someone might confess to Riri-chan during the cultural festival too.
No, they definitely will.
And I hate that thought, even I’m surprised by how much.
I don’t want to accept that.
My mind raced, trying to figure out how to stop anyone from confessing to Riri-chan.
------------------ 
77 The Center of My Heart
The day of the cultural festival.
It was mid-July, right around the time when the rainy season usually ends, and thankfully, the weather was good.
Each class was setting up for their respective projects.
I was organizing the food ingredients for our maid cafe.
“Hey, Suzuna-san.”
“Hmm?”
I turned around when Riri-chan called out to me.
“…Oh!”
“So? How do I look?”
Riri-chan was in her maid outfit.
A black, long-sleeved dress with a white apron, both adorned with frills.
With the long skirt, it was a classic maid look.
A safe choice for a dating sim.
“It suits you. You look cute.”
“O-Oh… really? I didn’t expect you to say that so directly.”
She asked for my opinion, and yet she’s embarrassed after being complimented.
“Yeah, everyone will come to see you, Riri-chan.”
“Well… I wonder…”
“They definitely will.”
Even though she’s beautiful, Riri-chan usually has a strong, gal-like appearance.
The cuteness of the maid outfit softens her image, making her look just the right amount of cute.
“But doesn’t this… frilly stuff… not suit me?”
“No, the long skirt gives it a mature look, so it’s not too cutesy.”
I think a miniskirt would also suit her, though.
“Seriously? But it’s hard to move in… and it’s hot.”
Apparently, Riri-chan feels restricted if her legs are covered.
“It must be tough, but do your best.”
“You too, Suzuna.”
The maids serving customers will probably have the hardest time, especially Riri-chan, who’ll be the center of attention…
“Yeah.”
But I was happy that she told me, “Let’s do our best together.”
◇◇◇
Once the cafe opened and customers started pouring in, I had almost nothing to do.
Since I’m not involved in the actual cooking, I only had minor tasks like restocking ingredients.
So I had time to observe the maid cafe.
“What can I get for you?”
Riri-chan was serving customers with a smile.
The cafe was more popular than expected, completely full.
The customers, both male and female, looked curiously at the maids, and Riri-chan was the most popular among them.
“That girl is super cute, isn’t she?”
“That’s Hinase Riri. Apparently, she doesn’t have a boyfriend.”
“No way.”
“Maybe she’s hiding it.”
I overheard the whispers of my classmates and students from other schools.
It’s natural for her to be the subject of rumors and attention.
But I still didn’t like the sight.
I felt a burning sensation in the pit of my stomach.
If this continues, I might do something I’ll regret.
“Amatsuki-san?”
“Ah, yes?”
The cooking team leader called out to me.
“We’re selling more than expected… and we’re running low on ingredients.”
“That’s a problem.”
The Riri-chan effect is powerful.
“I’m sorry to ask, but could you go get more ingredients? The others are busy cooking.”
We were originally planning to restock the ingredients after lunch.
At this rate, we’ll sell out before then.
“Yeah, sure. That’s my job.”
But it was good timing.
I can’t handle this atmosphere right now.
The ingredients are stored in the home economics room.
Maybe I can calm down a bit if I get out of here.
I quickly left the classroom.
◇◇◇
“…There we go.”
I packed the ingredients from the home economics room into a bag.
All I had to do was return to the classroom, but I wanted to take a detour.
The hallway was crowded with people.
The atmosphere was completely different from the usual school atmosphere, a festive buzz.
“Let’s check out that one next.”
“Yeah, okay.”
There were even couples walking around.
…I wonder if there are people who want to walk around like this with Riri-chan.
That thought made my chest tighten.
This is strange.
It’s such a natural thing.
It’s normal for Riri-chan to date someone, and there’s even a possibility that she’ll date Shindo-kun.
I knew that from the beginning, but it’s strange that just imagining it makes me so restless.
“You two, you’re too close. Please maintain a proper distance.”
“Yes, sir, sorry.”
“Sorry…”
Kanaori Reika, frowning, was patrolling the hallway.
“Seriously, people lose all sense of decency during the cultural festival… oh, it’s Amatsuki-san.”
“Hello.”
It was probably unusual to see someone walking around alone carrying ingredients when most people were in groups.
Kanaori-san noticed me right away and called out.
“Are you helping with your class’s project?”
“Ah, yes. We’re running low on ingredients… Are you on patrol, Kanaori-san?”
“Yes. Events like these are when order tends to break down. I have to keep an eye on things.”
Kanaori-san seemed even busier than usual.
“There are a lot of couples walking around.”
“A lot of people start dating during events like these. I don’t mind that, but they should still maintain proper decorum in public.”
“That’s true…”
The number of couples will definitely increase.
The thought I was trying to avoid crept back into my mind.
Riri-chan might also start dating someone during this event.
“Apparently, some people start dating just because of the atmosphere, so I don’t think it’s a very good trend.”
“The atmosphere…?”
Someone will probably confess to Riri-chan, just like during the sports festival.
Maybe the person she likes will be among them.
And even if not, Riri-chan is also human, so she might get caught up in the atmosphere.
What should I do if that happens…?
“What’s wrong? You look pale.”
“Ah, um…”
I don’t know how to sort out these feelings.
I just feel increasingly uneasy and nauseous.
“Is something bothering you?”
Kanaori-san looked at me with concern.
Maybe I can talk to her.
“Um, I have a close friend. And just thinking about her being confessed to, or starting to date someone, makes me feel sick. What do you think this is?”
“So you don’t want her to be… taken away by someone else?”
“Ah, yes… I think so.”
“Then it’s jealousy.”
“Ah, I see…”
I’ve been told that before.
Jealousy is a feeling you have towards someone you care about.
In my case, it’s jealousy because I don’t want my friend, Riri-chan, to be taken away.
“You like her, don’t you?”
“Eh, yes…”
“Then you have no choice but to… claim her yourself, before she’s taken away.”
“Claim her…?”
What does it even mean to “claim” a friend?
“You have to confess to her before someone else takes her away.”
“…Confess.”
That kind of “like” isn’t friendship.
“Yes, you… yearn for her, don’t you?”
“…Is that how it sounded?”
“That’s the only way it sounded.”
…So that’s how it sounds.
“Ah, but I’m not saying you should definitely pursue a relationship. A student’s main duty is to study.”
“Y-Yeah, of course. It would be surprising if you said that, Kanaori-san.”
Kanaori-san’s gaze suddenly sharpened.
“Excuse me, Amatsuki-san, there are some people I can’t overlook. I’ll have to excuse myself. —You there, what do you think this place is…?”
Kanaori-san went off to maintain order.
I headed towards the classroom.
…Romantic feelings.
That’s how it seemed to Kanaori-san.
Is that really what this is?
Does this jealousy stem from those kinds of feelings?
If so…
◇◇◇
“I feel bad for forcing you to help me.”
“It’s fine.”
Near the classroom, I saw something I didn’t want to see.
Riri-chan and an unfamiliar boy were walking side-by-side.
They seemed to be heading somewhere.
My heart pounded in my chest like never before.
A confession?
Is that the person Riri-chan likes?
I don’t know, I don’t know, but I don’t like this.
I couldn’t deny the unsettling feeling, no matter how much I tried to deceive myself.
“Then you have no choice but to claim her yourself, before she’s taken away.”
Kanaori-san’s words echoed strongly in my mind.
Maybe I can’t keep pretending not to see anymore.
“H-Hey…!”
I stepped between them.
“S-Suzuna? You were here?”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened in surprise, as if she hadn’t expected to see me.
“Just come with me.”
“E-Eh…?”
I grabbed Riri-chan’s arm and pulled her along.
“H-Hey, wait! What’s the meaning of this?! Hey, you, who is—”
As expected, it was a boy who wouldn’t just let it go.
He reached out to Riri-chan, but I pulled her closer before he could touch her.
“Don’t touch her. She’s mine.”
“Huh…?”
The boy’s mouth dropped open, confused.
That’s fine.
“Let’s go, Riri-chan.”
“Eh, where…?”
I led Riri-chan away, not even returning to the classroom.
78 Stay By My Side
“Suzuna, Suzuna, hey, Suzuna.”
I ignored Riri-chan’s voice and kept walking.
It’s conspicuous to be walking around with a beautiful girl in a maid outfit, but I don’t care.
As I walked further and further into the back of the school, the number of people gradually dwindled.
I opened the door to an unused music room.
“Come in.”
Riri-chan looked bewildered.
“Why?”
“I need to talk to you.”
“What about the maid cafe?”
Riri-chan tilted her head, fiddling with her skirt.
She looked cute, but this wasn’t the time for that.
“It’s fine for now.”
“O-Okay.”
I practically dragged her inside.
The music room was slightly cooler than the other rooms, perhaps because it was dimly lit.
Riri-chan, who entered first, turned around.
Her skirt swirled, a picturesque scene.
“So what’s wrong? I can’t talk for long; I don’t want to cause trouble for everyone.”
“…”
So the maid cafe is more important to her.
Being fawned over by everyone is more important than me.
“It’s fine, there are other maids.”
“That’s not the point. They’re busy and short-handed.”
That’s strange.
Riri-chan was about to go somewhere with that boy earlier.
That boy is okay, but I’m not?
She usually prioritizes me.
“It’s fine, just listen to me now.”
“Okay, okay, I will. But make it quick.”
“That last part was unnecessary.”
“What was?”
“Saying ‘make it quick’ makes me not want to talk.”
Riri-chan sighed.
“Suzuna, you’re being selfish. You have to do your job.”
“What about me?”
“I’m listening to you right now, aren’t I?”
“…”
That’s true, but that’s not what I mean.
I want her to listen to me properly.
“Is it something you’re hesitant to talk about? Then I’ll listen properly later when we have free time. Until then, okay?”
Did she think she could appease me with that?
Riri-chan walked past me, about to leave the music room.
That’s not okay.
I grabbed her shoulder and made her turn around.
“Suzuna?”
“Don’t go.”
“…I said I’ll listen to you later.”
“No.”
No, no, no.
I don’t want to see Riri-chan being fawned over by other people again.
I want her to be only mine.
So I don’t want to let her go.
“What’s wrong, Suzuna? This isn’t like you.”
“What’s ‘like me’?”
“You’re usually more… reasonable.”
“I’m not.”
Especially when it comes to Riri-chan.
“I can’t listen to you this time, Suzuna. It’ll cause trouble for other people.”
No.
If Riri-chan is seen by other people again, I won’t be able to handle it.
Then, at least…
I pulled Riri-chan closer.
“H-Hey, Suzuna! That’s dangerous… what are you doing?”
“I’m going to bite you.”
At least, I have to leave my mark on her.
I can’t stand it otherwise.
I reached for Riri-chan’s chest.
“Eh?!”
But I couldn’t.
Riri-chan isn’t wearing a blouse today.
She’s wearing a dress that’s buttoned all the way up.
“S-See? There’s no point in doing that. Just give up…”
But there’s no rule that says I have to bite her chest.
I knelt on the floor.
There was a black skirt in front of me, and I lifted it.
Her white thighs were revealed.
“H-Hey, Suzuna! What are you doing?!”
“What do you mean? It’s obvious, isn’t it?”
“Why are you lifting my skirt and looking at my legs?!”
“…Are you… embarrassed?”
Riri-chan is saying strange things.
I only lifted it to her thighs.
“You always show this much.”
“That’s different…”
I don’t understand.
I ignored Riri-chan and touched her thigh.
Her skin was slightly damp with sweat, and my fingers clung to it.
“H-Hey, Suzuna, what are you going to…?”
I didn’t reply, knowing she’d try to stop me.
I brought my lips closer to Riri-chan’s leg.
My lips touched the inside of her thigh, and then I bit down.
A soft, yielding sensation transmitted through my teeth.
I bit harder.
“O-Ouch…”
Serves you right.
You wouldn’t listen to me, and you were about to go to the maid cafe.
Riri-chan should just listen to me.
I should leave my mark on her like this.
“Stop it…”
Riri-chan pushed my head, and I lost my balance.
“…Ah.”
—Thud
I fell backwards, and a jolt of pain shot through my back.
The pain subsided quickly, but it made a loud noise.
“S-Sorry, Suzuna! Are you okay…?”
She probably didn’t mean to push me down.
Maybe she was worried that I was hurt because of the loud noise.
Riri-chan rushed over and offered me her hand.
“I’m fine.”
I swatted her hand away and sat up.
“Suzuna…”
Riri-chan’s face was contorted with guilt.
“If you want me to forgive you, listen to me.”
“What do you want me to do?”
Her voice sounded like she might actually listen, perhaps out of guilt.
“Stay here. Don’t leave me.”
“Then what about the maid cafe…?”
“It’s fine, let’s skip it.”
“But you have work to do, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan pointed at the bag of ingredients on the floor.
“I don’t care about that.”
I tossed it aside.
“You’re being strange, Suzuna.”
“Is it bad to be strange?”
Whose fault is that?
“That doesn’t make sense, there’s no need to do that.”
“There is. I don’t want you to leave, Riri-chan, so stay here.”
“There’s no point in staying here. We can be together later.”
“No. If you go outside, other people will see you, and you’ll interact with them. I don’t want to see that anymore.”
“What… do you mean?”
Riri-chan looked at me with genuine confusion.
“Exactly what I said. I don’t want to see you being fawned over by other people.”
“Why… do you think that?”
The reason I think that.
Riri-chan wants to know.
But that’s the hardest thing to explain, and it’s something I don’t fully understand myself.
This feeling, stemming from jealousy, is built upon a more fundamental emotion.
If I acknowledge and verbalize it, our relationship might change irrevocably.
That scares me.
I don’t know what I’d do in a world without Riri-chan.
I didn’t mind being alone at first. I didn’t care about loneliness.
It’s because Riri-chan taught me about… being together, about friendship, that I’ve become like this.
“Take responsibility.”
“Responsibility for what?”
“You said you’d teach me.”
“Teach you what?”
“You said you’d teach me about romantic feelings.”
“Eh…”
My heart started pounding.
My blood rushed, and my face felt hot.
But my fingers and toes were ice-cold, and my head was spinning.
This doesn’t make sense.
I’m trying to be honest with myself, but my body is rejecting it.
“Isn’t this… what it is…?”
“Suzuna…”
“I try to ignore it when you’re getting along with other people, but I can’t, and it makes me incredibly frustrated.”
“…”
“But when I’m with you like this, even just talking to you makes me feel calm. I was so irritated with you just now, but when you’re here, it’s like a switch flips, and I’m back to normal.”
A cycle of reassurance and anxiety.
It doesn’t make sense.
An endless loop of feeling at ease when Riri-chan is with me and anxious when she’s not.
I’ll be crushed by anxiety if you’re not by my side.
“It’s your fault for making me so unstable. So take responsibility.”
“So that means…”
I’m not good at understanding my own emotions, but…
I think this is what it means to be constantly thinking about Riri-chan.
“This is… what it means to… like someone, right?”
“…!”
Riri-chan was speechless.
Afraid of her response, I continued, my words tumbling out.
“This is the feeling you taught me, Riri-chan. So teach me… what to do next…”
My chest tightened, and it was hard to breathe.
Why is it so painful just to say what I’m thinking?
It was so painful that tears started streaming down my face, even though I didn’t understand why.
“Hey, what should I do? How can I feel better? I wish I hadn’t learned this if it’s going to make me feel this way.”
That’s why I’m so messed up about Tachibana-san, Shindo-kun, the confession, the maid cafe, everything.
I didn’t want to become like this.
“Stay by my side.”
“Suzuna…”
But if that’s not possible.
If Riri-chan has someone else she likes…
“If it’s this painful, I should have just stayed alo—”
My words were cut off.
Because Riri-chan’s lips covered mine.
------------------ 
79 Entwined
Riri-chan’s lips were on mine.
Soft and warm.
A sweet fragrance, Riri-chan’s scent, wafted through the air.
Riri-chan’s long eyelashes, her eyes closed, were right in front of me.
My first kiss.
The suddenness of it left me speechless.
After a while, our lips naturally parted.
“…”
“…”
Silence between us.
But Riri-chan looked directly at me.
Her eyes seemed to burn hotter than usual.
This… seriousness… is what I wanted.
“R-Riri-chan, this is…”
“This is the answer.”
“The answer…?”
A kiss as a response to a confession.
Is that… what this means?
“Yeah, don’t you understand?”
“Well, I think I do, but… I want to hear you say i—mmn”
Riri-chan didn’t wait for me to finish and covered my mouth with hers again.
The second kiss was more aggressive than the first, her lips devouring mine.
Riri-chan’s lips pressed against mine repeatedly.
Each time, it felt like our saliva mingled, becoming indistinguishable.
It felt… indecent.
The second kiss was long.
“…Haa… Riri-chan, I… I can’t breathe…”
I was nervous because it was my first kiss, and I didn’t know when to breathe.
“Calm down, Suzuna.”
“I can’t! You might be used to this, Riri-chan, but I’ve never done this before…”
“This is my first time too.”
Her face was too close, our bodies pressed together.
So her voice resonated directly in my ears, making my heart pound.
“Suzuna…”
“Eh, ah, wait…?!”
Riri-chan leaned over me.
Before I could resist, I was pushed down, my gaze fixed on the ceiling.
Riri-chan looked down at me, her long hair brushing against my cheek.
I didn’t notice it earlier because of the pain, but the floor against my back was cold.
“R-Riri-chan…? Um, let’s… sit up and talk…?”
I just want to hear her response to my confession.
I have a feeling it will be positive.
So I want to talk to her, not do this.
I tried to push myself up with my elbows.
“No.”
“Oof.”
She pinned my arms to the floor.
Riri-chan was straddling me, and she was stronger than me, so I couldn’t move at all.
“Just stay still.”
Riri-chan’s voice was lower than usual.
It felt like I was seeing a side of her I didn’t know, and I was filled with both anticipation and anxiety.
“Um, what is… this…?”
“It’s your fault, Suzuna. I was trying to hold back, but…”
“H-Hold back… from what…?”
She placed her hand on top of mine.
Not just holding hands, but intertwining our fingers.
“If you bring me to a deserted place like this and suddenly tell me you like me… I can’t stop myself.”
“C-Can’t stop…?”
What is she talking about…?
It seems like we’re on the same page, but also not.
“Listen to me for once.”
Riri-chan’s tongue traced a wet path along my neck.
She moved upwards, her lips brushing against my cheek and then my earlobe.
“Riri-chan, wh-where are you biting…?”
Riri-chan nibbled on my earlobe.
Her warm breath against my skin sent shivers down my spine.
“You always bite me hard enough to leave a mark. This is nothing.”
“That’s not the poi—mmn”
Now Riri-chan’s tongue traced the outline of my ear.
From the outside to the inside, her tongue delved into my ear.
The unfamiliar sensation made me react.
“Suzuna, did you just… moan…?”
Riri-chan’s whisper, mixed with her breath, teased my ear.
“Th-That’s… because you’re… licking me there…”
This doesn’t make sense, this doesn’t make sense.
Please, stop doing strange things.
I can only react instinctively to these unfamiliar sensations.
This is bad, I thought, and put strength into my arms.
Perhaps because my focus on resisting had wavered, my arms, pinned to the floor, lifted slightly.
“Not yet.”
But it was only for a moment.
Riri-chan quickly pinned them down again.
“Ugh.”
And this time, she pinned both my arms together, holding my wrists down with one hand.
I’m so weak.
“You’re the one who started this, Suzuna, so you have to deal with the consequences.”
“Consequences… of what…?”
I feel like Riri-chan is skipping a step.
Maybe it’s my fault, but it feels like the brakes have stopped working.
“I’m going to touch you.”
“Eh?!”
Riri-chan’s free hand lifted my skirt.
I couldn’t see it, but I could tell from the rustling sound and the feeling of air against my skin.
And there’s no doubt about it, since Riri-chan’s gaze was fixed on my lower body.
“You have beautiful legs, Suzuna.”
“Wh-Where are you looking…?!”
My face flushed.
This is embarrassing, so embarrassing.
My legs aren’t meant to be seen by anyone.
“I’m looking at your legs.”
Don’t say it like it’s the most natural thing in the world!
“No, no, no! Put my skirt down!”
“Your legs are thinner than mine. I’m jealous.”
“I didn’t ask for your opinion! Put it down!”
“You’ve been looking at my legs and even biting me. Isn’t it a little unfair to say you don’t want the same?”
Don’t compare me to you, the exhibitionist!
I always keep my skirt below my knees, making sure no one sees.
“Just… stop…”
“This is what you did earlier, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s cold fingertips touched my thigh.
But it wasn’t just a touch; she caressed my leg, tracing its shape.
She ran her hand up and down repeatedly, as if to savor the texture of my skin.
“I didn’t… I didn’t touch you like that!”
“Hmm? You think this is… indecent, Suzuna?”
What is she talking about?
“Don’t talk about me like I’m a pervert.”
“You are one.”
Anyone would think that after being licked and then touched like this!
And Riri-chan’s hand kept moving upwards.
Closer and closer to a sensitive area, reaching my inner thigh.
“Riri-chan, that’s…”
This is bad, going any further is bad.
I’m already a mess from having my ear and leg touched; anything more, and I’ll lose my mind.
I instinctively kicked my legs.
“Suzuna… you don’t like it?”
Just as I felt her fingers brush against my underwear, she stopped.
Riri-chan looked into my face, as if trying to confirm something.
Please don’t look at me with such a sad expression.
“B-Because… I don’t know what will happen if you go any further…”
“It’s fine, it’s me.”
“That’s not the point…”
Riri-chan stared at me for a moment, then said,
“You… like me, don’t you?”
“…!”
…That’s not fair.
That’s so unfair.
Using my own words against me like that.
That’s a low blow.
“Suzuna, do you?”
But how should I answer?
It’s not good, and it’s not bad.
But if that’s what Riri-chan wants, then I think it’s fine.
But it’s still embarrassing to admit it.
Completely confused, I looked away.
“…”
“Suzuna, I don’t know if you don’t say anything. I’ll stop if you really don’t like it.”
She’s acting kind, but she’s not kind at all.
Making me decide on such an important matter.
I’ve already stopped struggling, I’ve closed my mouth.
I’ve compromised and chosen silence.
It’s mean of her to make me say it.
There’s no way I can refuse.
She knows that.
“What do you want me to do?”
She whispered like a devil with the voice of an angel.
“…Do what you want.”
That was the best I could do.
80 Say You Like Me
“Do what you want,” I said, putting on a brave face.
“Suzuna.”
And just as Riri-chan’s hand reached for my “Secret place”—
Clatter
The sound of the door opening.
“…Eh?”
A girl’s voice.
““Eh?””
Our voices.
Kanaori Reika had entered the music room.
“What are you two doing?”
D-Did she see…?
Did Kanaori-san see?
Well, Riri-chan was leaning over me, so for better or worse, nothing else should have been visible.
My skirt was also back in place, so she shouldn’t have been able to tell what we were doing.
Riri-chan quickly stood up.
If we play it cool, we might be able to get away with this…
“I-It’s nothing! What are you doing here?”
Riri-chan, you’re panicking too much!
You’re stuttering!
Look, Kanaori-san’s expression hardened…
“Who are you? Don’t call me ‘you,’ it’s rude.”
And Kanaori-san also said something strange.
“Huh? What’s that? What kind of joke is that?”
“…? You’re the one being rude to someone you’ve just met. Do you think I’m the one making a joke?”
Kanaori-san, with a straight face, insisted that she didn’t know Riri-chan.
“It’s Hinase! Hinase! Hinase Riri!”
Kanaori-san’s eyes widened at those words.
“Oh, it’s Hinase-san. I didn’t recognize you.”
“So you’re the one who’s making a joke.”
“No, you weren’t wearing your usual… indecent attire. I didn’t know who you were.”
It’s true that Riri-chan is wearing a maid outfit, not her usual disheveled uniform, but…
“Don’t talk about me like you identify me by my clothes.”
“How else am I supposed to identify you?”
“By my face, obviously!”
“I couldn’t bear to look at someone so… indecent, so I didn’t observe you any further.”
Kanaori-san shook her head and then turned her gaze towards me.
“Anyway… who is the other person?”
I couldn’t run away after being called out by Kanaori-san.
I stood up.
“…Sorry, it’s me.”
“Oh, Amatsuki-san…”
Kanaori-san sounded surprised.
She didn’t expect it to be me, it seems.
“I heard noises coming from the music room, which is usually empty. I thought it was… another couple engaging in inappropriate behavior…”
Kanaori-san looked back and forth between Riri-chan and me.
“What were you two doing here?”
She asked a natural question.
“It’s none of your business.”
Riri-chan brushed her off.
“It is my business. Amatsuki-san has an important appointment, and you’re interrupting her.”
She’s talking about what I told her in the hallway earlier.
“I-It’s fine! That appointment is… over!”
“Excuse me…?”
Kanaori-san tilted her head, looking confused.
“Anyway, we’re leaving now.”
Riri-chan grabbed my hand and started walking.
“Wait, I haven’t heard what you were doing yet.”
But Kanaori-san blocked our path.
Riri-chan faltered for a moment, then…
“This.”
She pointed at her black skirt.
“We were… helping each other… put on our maid outfits.”
“And that’s why you were on top of Amatsuki-san?”
“…That sounds dubious.”
Kanaori-san glared at Riri-chan.
Her eyes were filled with suspicion.
“Is that true, Amatsuki-san?”
Now she was asking for my confirmation.
Maybe she’s worried about me.
“…Yes, that’s what we were doing.”
I’m sorry, Kanaori-san.
I’ll go along with Riri-chan’s lie.
“…I see.”
Kanaori-san sighed, seemingly giving up.
“We have to work at the maid cafe, so we’ll be going now.”
“As you wish.”
I bowed to Kanaori-san and left the music room.
◇◇◇
Riri-chan was holding my hand as we walked.
It’s our usual routine, and yet it felt… different.
“School was a bad idea, wasn’t it?”
Riri-chan spoke in a low voice, only loud enough for me to hear, without turning around.
Remembering what just happened made me feel like I was about to explode.
“Y-Yeah…”
It’s true, we should choose the time and place carefully.
And yet, I’m surprised by how… bold I was, willing to accept it.
But Riri-chan probably feels the same.
Because her fingertips, usually cold, are warm now.
Even though I can’t see her face, I know she’s probably blushing too.
“Let’s go back to the classroom and work.”
“O-Okay…”
Good.
Now I don’t have to be jealous of other people, and I can be with Riri-chan forev—
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Riri-chan kissed me, and she was about to do more, but…
She hasn’t said the important words yet.
“I like you.”
She hasn’t said that yet.
My heart, which had been light just a moment ago, suddenly felt heavy.
This is bad. I’m going to lose it again.
…I need to hear her say it.
“Um, Riri…”
“Speaking of which…”
We spoke at the same time.
Riri-chan, who was walking ahead, stopped, and I stopped too.
Riri-chan turned around and looked at me.
“Suzuna, since when have you liked me?”
“H-Huh?!”
Why is she asking that here?!
We’re still in the special classrooms area, so there aren’t many people around, but it’s not as deserted as the music room.
“R-Riri-chan, what if someone hears you?”
“It’s fine, even if people hear us say ‘like,’ they won’t think it’s that kind of like. They’ll think it’s just as friends. If they think otherwise, they’re the weird ones.”
“Th-That might be true, but…”
It’s still unsettling.
“So, since when?”
“Um, well, that’s…”
What kind of question is that?
I’ve never thought about “since when.”
I thought she was cute and a good person from the beginning, but I also thought she was too popular for me.
My heart raced when I went to her house for the first time, and if that’s love, then maybe it was then…
But I also think it started when I got jealous of Tachibana-san.
Or maybe the jealousy during the sports festival and the cultural festival was stronger…
I don’t know.
But I became clearly aware of it just now.
“…Recently, I guess.”
I gave a vague answer, summing it up.
It’s a gradual thing, a blurry line.
“Then we’re not a good match.”
“…Eh?”
Riri-chan frowned, as if troubled.
Not a good match.
Does that mean… I’m not good enough for her?
I know that.
But I couldn’t help it.
That’s why I confessed.
“Am I… not enough?”
“Yeah, not at all.”
So what happened earlier… was just playing around?
That kind of ending…
“Because, in my case—”
Riri-chan started walking again.
She stood next to me and cupped my ear.
“Since that day, when we first met in town and you saved me… I’ve always liked you, Suzuna.”
Her breath against my ear was warm.
Riri-chan took a step back.
My temperature skyrocketed, and she smiled, watching my reaction.
“So you, saying ‘recently,’ are still a novice. My feelings have been around for much longer.”
“S-S-So that means…”
My mind went blank, and I couldn’t speak properly.
“Ah, no, that’s not the right phrasing either…”
Not the right phrasing?!
My rapidly rising temperature plummeted—
“I really like you, Suzuna. Please go out with me.”
—And then exploded.
“Ehehe.”
And Riri-chan herself was laughing.
And…
“You should have whispered that! What if someone heard you?!”
Fortunately, no one heard, but it was a blatant confession.
“It’s fine.”
“It’s not!”
This is bad.
“More importantly, what do you think, Suzuna?”
“What do I…?”
I was the one who confessed, but now it’s like she’s the one who confessed to me.
It’s strange, and the answer is obvious, and yet…
“…Y-Yes, please.”
“Yes! We’ll be together forever!”
Riri-chan beamed.
I really do like her.
------------------ 
81 Cute Girl: Hinase Riri’s Side
I walked down the hallway, hand-in-hand with Suzuna.
Suzuna’s hand is always warm.
But today, I couldn’t feel the warmth as much.
…It’s probably because my own body temperature is higher than usual.
◇◇◇
“It’s your fault for making me so unstable. So take responsibility.”
“This is… what it means to… like someone, right?”
“This is the feeling you taught me, Riri-chan. So teach me… what to do next…”
“Hey, what should I do? How can I feel better? I wish I hadn’t learned this if it’s going to make me feel this way.”
◇◇◇
Remembering Suzuna, collapsed on the floor, baring her heart to me, made my body heat up.
No one has ever spoken to me so directly, and the gap between that and her usual image was overwhelming.
To think that Suzuna, so delicate and hesitant to change our relationship, felt that way about me…
And she even put it into words…
I’m falling for her even more.
I’m so happy that our feelings are mutual.
“R-Riri-chan…”
Suzuna’s voice called out from behind me.
“What’s wrong?”
Suzuna was looking down.
She often does that, but today, it seemed more pronounced.
“Ah, you’re walking a little too fast.”
“Ah! Sorry, sorry!”
I can’t help it.
I got so excited that I unconsciously quickened my pace.
I have to be more mindful since Suzuna is smaller than me.
Even that is cute, though.
“No, it’s fine. We have to hurry back.”
Suzuna sighed as she spoke, and I couldn’t help but look at her lips.
Suzuna’s lips look thin at first glance, but they were actually quite soft.
I thought about kissing her again…
“Riri-chan? Aren’t you coming?”
“Ah, right. There’s no need to stop.”
This is bad, bad.
I was having inappropriate thoughts about Suzuna again.
I started walking again, trying to shake off those thoughts.
…But it can’t be helped.
She confessed her feelings, let me kiss her, and almost let me go further.
Thinking about it calmly, isn’t it a miracle that Suzuna would allow me to do that much?
So I can’t help but think about it.
How surprisingly slender Suzuna’s legs are, how her skin is smooth and dry even on such a hot day.
How her voice gets higher and cuter when she’s feeling something…
Ah, I can’t get enough of that Suzuna.
“R-Riri-chan, you’re walking too fast…!”
“Eh, really?”
Not again, I thought, and slowed down.
I might have unconsciously quickened my pace again, lost in thought… or rather, daydreaming about Suzuna.
“Are you doing this on purpose…?”
“No, of course not.”
“You’re saying that, but you’re actually angry, aren’t you?”
“Angry…? About what?”
I don’t think there’s anything for me to be angry at Suzuna about today.
“You’re angry because I bit your leg.”
Ah, that’s right… I forgot.
The aftermath was so overwhelming that I forgot about it.
“I’m not angry. Or rather, I forgot about it.”
“Lies. You wouldn’t normally speed up like that.”
W-Well… it’s not normal.
But that’s why it happened…
“And you were walking even faster than before.”
“Eh, seriously?”
My unconscious is scary.
How oblivious can I be?
But I can’t tell that to Suzuna…
“Riri-chan, you pushed my head away when I bit you. You were angry, weren’t you?”
“No, no, that’s not true! It just… hurt a little too much, so it was a reflex…”
I wasn’t really angry.
But Suzuna’s biting habit has gotten a bit… intense lately.
I think she should be aware of that.
It would be fine if she were a little gentler.
“It hurt so much that you pushed me to the floor?”
“Well, that’s… true, but…”
And please don’t remind me of that now.
It makes me remember what happened afterward.
Ah, impure thoughts! More impure thoughts!
To end this topic, I decided to offer convincing proof.
“Look, see? There’s a mark! Doesn’t it look painful?”
I lifted my skirt and showed Suzuna the bite mark on my thigh.
There was a clear, large, red mark.
It looked quite painful.
“…”
Suzuna quickly looked away.
Why?
“Suzuna? What’s wrong? Finally realizing how painful your actions were?”
“Put it down.”
“Huh?”
“Just put your skirt down. Don’t show me your leg.”
…What’s the meaning of this?
She’s the one who bit me, and now she doesn’t want to see the mark?
I don’t understand.
“But if you don’t show me, I can’t convey how much it hurt.”
“It’s fine, I don’t want to see it.”
“Even though you bit me?”
“I don’t want to see it.”
…Suzuna’s ears seem red.
“Is there a reason you don’t want to see it?”
“There is.”
“Why?”
“Just because.”
“You were the one who lifted my skirt and looked earlier.”
“That was then. And you were the one who was embarrassed, so why are you acting so nonchalant now?”
“It’s embarrassing to be seen without warning, but it’s fine if there’s a reason, and I’m showing you on purpose.”
“That’s so arbitrary.”
“That’s how it is.”
Even I think I’m being inconsistent.
“What about you, Suzuna? Why can you look at it before but not now…?”
“W-Well, it’s obvious! We were about to… do that earlier… Showing you my leg now would have a different meaning…”
“Ah… I see…”
I finally understood why Suzuna blushed and didn’t want to see my leg.
Hearing that made me feel embarrassed too, so I quickly lowered my skirt.
“S-So you think about those things too, Suzuna…”
“O-Of course I do! Anyone would… after that…”
“After… that…?”
“Don’t make me say it! I’m definitely not saying it!”
“Oh, hmm…”
That’s a little disappointing.
But I’m also happy that she’s thinking about the same things.
“Anyway, I’m not angry. I was just lost in thought and unconsciously sped up.”
“Lost in thought about what?”
“Well…”
Well, since Suzuna told me…
It wouldn’t be fair for me to hide it either.
“Like… what we were doing in the music room earlier…”
“…A-Ah, uh…”
Suzuna’s ears turned bright red.
Maybe I shouldn’t have said that.
“…You pervert…”
And I got called a pervert.
“Hey, we’re both in the same boat!”
“Don’t think about that!”
“You were thinking about it too, Suzuna.”
“That’s because you showed me your leg. You were thinking about it on your own, so you’re the pervert!”
Wh-What kind of logic is that…?
“Then I remembered because I saw your lips!”
“M-My li—That’s normal! Should I cover them with a mask?”
A-Ah… well, that’s true.
“Pervert, Riri, you pervert.”
“I don’t want to hear that from the girl who bit my leg!”
“So you are angry!”
“I’m not!”
I’m sorry, Suzuna, but…
It’s cute how you’re hiding your embarrassment by raising your voice.
82 My Body Reacts
“Riri, aren’t you a little too late?”
“Sorry, sorry.”
When we returned to the classroom, Riri-chan was being scolded by Tachibana-san.
Since they’re busy, it’s natural for her to be angry if Riri-chan is this late.
And since I’m the reason, I felt bad.
“How can it take this long to walk a lost boy from another school to the exit?”
Ah…
That’s right, Riri-chan was walking with an unfamiliar boy, and I got fired up seeing that, but…
He really was a stranger.
Oh no…
I feel even more guilty…
“So, I said I’m sorry.”
“Well… it’s fine. Did you manage to see him off?”
“…P-Probably.”
“Probably?”
“He wasn’t there anymore, so he’s probably fine.”
“Hmm? Where were you, and what were you doing, Riri?”
Riri-chan’s actions were completely inexplicable.
I should just tell them it’s my fault…
“Excuse me, can we order?”
“Ah, yes!”
Riri-chan immediately responded to the customer’s call.
“Ah, Riri, we were still talking…”
She seamlessly switched to work mode and shut down Tachibana-san’s question.
That’s impressive.
“Seriously…”
Tachibana-san seemed to give up and went back to work.
“Amatsuki-san? Did you bring the ingredients?”
“Ah, yes. Sorry I’m late.”
I handed the plastic bag to the leader.
“No, it’s fine, we still had some left. Let me know if you need anything else.”
So, nothing happened to me…
I had nothing else to do, so I decided to observe the maid cafe again.
“Have a nice day, miss.”
Riri-chan saw off two girls from a lower year.
“D-Did you see…? That was Hinase Riri-senpai, wasn’t it?”
“She was so cute!”
Fufu…
If this were me from a while ago, just hearing those words would have messed with my head.
But I’m different now.
I’m calm enough to listen to gossip.
That’s right, that’s right, Riri-chan is cute.
“Her usual gal aura was gone, so she was twice as cute, wasn’t she?”
“Yeah, no one would be able to resist her like that.”
…Ah, maybe not.
Hearing that made me feel… complicated.
I like the cute Riri-chan, but a popular Riri-chan is a different story.
The thought of so many people looking at her with those eyes made me feel restless…
“Suzuna.”
“Ah, yes!”
Riri-chan suddenly appeared next to me.
“I’m done with my shift.”
“Ah, I see…”
The maid cafe shifts are divided into morning and afternoon.
But since we’re running low on ingredients, the people on the afternoon shift might not have much to do.
“You’re only working in the morning too, right, Suzuna?”
“Yeah.”
This beautiful, cute girl… likes me.
It didn’t feel real earlier.
Now that I’ve calmed down and processed the situation, it still doesn’t make sense.
Is this really happening…?
“So, we have free time. Let’s look around together.”
“O-Okay.”
Riri-chan took my hand, and we left the classroom.
“Maid outfits really don’t suit me.”
Riri-chan had changed back into her uniform.
Her sleeves were rolled up, her blouse unbuttoned to the second button, and her skirt was above her knees.
She was back to her usual self.
“It suited you, though.”
“But it’s hard to move in. Forget it.”
…I wonder why.
When she was in her maid outfit, it felt unreal, but seeing her in her uniform suddenly made it feel real.
It made Riri-chan feel closer…
“Suzuna, are you hungry?”
“I’m… normal, I guess…”
As it got closer to lunchtime, the number of students from other schools and their families increased, making the hallway even more crowded.
Riri-chan suggested we get something to eat.
“Is there anything you want to eat? Well, I don’t know if they have it here, but…”
“A-Anything is fine…”
Anything Riri-chan likes is fine.
I don’t have any particular requests.
“What about drinks? Want to buy something?”
“No, either way is fine…”
I’ll drink if there is something, and I won’t if there isn’t.
“…Suzuna.”
Riri-chan suddenly stopped.
“Yes?”
“…You’re being stiff.”
Stiff?
Is she talking about our joined hands?
“Don’t look at my hands.”
Apparently not.
“Your attitude, your reactions.”
“E-Eh, is that so…?”
“You’re being… very indifferent, distant.”
“I’m not trying to be…”
Riri-chan looked at me with a puzzled expression.
Please don’t stare at me like that…
“Why are you looking away?”
“Because you’re looking at me, Riri-chan.”
“It’s normal to look at you, Suzuna.”
“No, don’t look.”
“That’s weird.”
She might be right.
But I don’t know what’s normal anymore.
I don’t know what to do.
Ah, I’m overthinking it, and my hands are starting to sweat…
“R-Riri-chan, let go of my hand.”
“Eh, what? You’re pushing me away even more? What’s going on?”
“No, it’s not that… you know, right?”
If this continues, my sweat will get on Riri-chan’s hand…
“No, no, that’s not it. You’re trying to run away.”
“I-I’m not running away! I’m not a child!”
“You were running away all the time at first.”
“That was then!”
“Your attitude is similar to back then.”
Seriously…
Why is she getting closer when I say that?
Her face is too close, I can smell her scent, and I don’t know where to look.
And thinking about all that is making my hands sweat even more.
“J-Just… l-let go.”
“Absolutely not! You have to tell me why you’re being so distant!”
Riri-chan’s grip tightened.
N-No, stop it!
My sweaty hands, my dirty sweat is getting on Riri-chan’s beautiful hands!
Okay, I’ll endure it and tell her, since I feel bad.
“My… my hands are sweating! It’s embarrassing, so let go!”
“Hmm? …Ah, well, now that you mention it…”
Riri-chan squeezed my hand to check.
“No, stop it!”
“That’s unusual. You don’t usually sweat, Suzuna.”
Why is she calmly analyzing this?!
“It’s gross, isn’t it? So let go!”
“It’s fine, yours isn’t gross, Suzuna.”
Why is she nodding with such a nice smile? Is she crazy?
“Just… let… go…”
I tried to pull my hand away with my other hand, but it was no use.
Ah, her grip is too strong…
“So why are you acting like this and sweating so much? You’re not sick, are you?”
“…It’s… nothing, okay?”
“No, I won’t let go until you tell me. And stop being so uncute.”
She’s squeezing my hand again.
She can definitely feel the moisture.
This is impossible!
“Okay, I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you!”
“Go ahead.”
…Damn it.
Riri-chan always has the upper hand…
“…I-I’m… embarrassed.”
“Embarrassed?”
“W-Well… you know… we’re… d-d-dating… now, and…”
“Yeah, we are.”
Why can she say that so casually?
Am I the strange one?
“Thinking about that… makes you seem like a different person, Riri-chan… And I wonder if you see me differently too… and all sorts of things…”
“…Oh!”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened for the first time.
“Suzuna, you’re so cute!”
“Wh-What is?”
“You’re so conscious of me that you’re embarrassed, aren’t you?”
“…I’m not embarrassed!”
“Look me in the eye and say that.”
That’s impossible.
“See? I told you. Now let go.”
“…Hmm? Fufu.”
She squeezed my hand tighter.
“R-Riri-chan! That’s not what you said!”
“Sorry, you’re too cute, so I don’t want to let go.”
“Th-That doesn’t make sense!”
“Come on, let’s go.”
“W-Wait…!”
She’s a liar!
Riri-chan isn’t listening to me at all.
Th-This is embarrassing…
------------------ 
83 Sweets
“So, Suzuna, what do you want to eat?”
“…Um…”
Riri-chan was still holding my hand.
The more I thought about how awkward this situation was, the more my hands sweated, and I just wanted her to let go.
I wasn’t even thinking about food.
“If you don’t decide, I’ll keep holding your hand.”
“It would be solved if you just let go…”
“I’ll let go when we eat, so choose something.”
Riri-chan was completely leaving the decision to me.
The situation would only get worse if I stalled, so I had to decide quickly.
But nothing caught my eye as I looked around the classroom projects.
I thought about just randomly picking something, but I felt like the perceptive Riri-chan would see through me.
I looked at the shops near the school gate through the window.
“…Ah.”
“Did you find something?”
“Well, if I had to choose…”
“What? Which one?”
Riri-chan also looked out the window.
Our shoulders touched.
“R-Riri-chan, you’re too close.”
“It’s natural for us to be close since we’re holding hands.”
“Having our bodies touch is too much.”
“Eh, you don’t like being close to me, Suzuna…?”
“…”
This is bad.
My hands won’t stop sweating.
If I keep having this kind of conversation with her, she’ll completely take control.
I’ll change the subject.
“Crêpes.”
“…Crêpes?”
I pointed at one of the stalls near the school gate.
“So girly.”
Riri-chan’s mouth dropped open.
I am a girl, but what’s that supposed to mean?
“…What do you mean by that?”
“You want crêpes for lunch, Suzuna?”
“Is that not allowed?”
They’re selling them, so it’s fine, isn’t it?
“No, I just thought… you’d want something… more substantial? Crêpes are dessert.”
“As long as I’m full, it’s fine.”
I’m not picky.
As long as my stomach is full.
“Well, you’re not going to be full with that, are you?”
Riri-chan doesn’t seem to approve of having sweets for lunch.
Then she should have said so from the beginning.
“If you’re that against it, you can choose, Riri-chan. Anything is fine with me.”
“That’s not what I’m saying!”
“…You’re so troublesome, Riri-chan.”
“Ah, sorry, sorry. Okay, let’s do that.”
Riri-chan led me towards the entrance.
She still wouldn’t let go of my hand.
◇◇◇
“One crêpe, please.”
Riri-chan placed the order at the third-year stall.
“Thank you. I’ll make it right away.”
It felt hotter outside than in the hallway because of the sun.
Making crêpes on a hot plate under this scorching sun must be hell.
The cultural festival is tough.
“Here you go.”
“Thank you.”
Riri-chan paid and received the crêpe.
…Wait a minute.
“Riri-chan, what about mine?”
I was just watching silently because she was doing everything, but it’s just one crêpe, and I’ll pay for it.
Did she forget about me?
She’s still holding my hand.
“You have one.”
Riri-chan held up the crêpe she received.
“No… I’ll pay for it.”
“I’ll buy it for you.”
“That’s okay, there’s no reason for you to buy it for me.”
“For my cute girlfriend, what other reason do I need?”
“…”
This girl…
My heart can’t take this…
“It’s too hot here, and there’s nowhere to sit, so let’s move.”
“Ah, um…”
Riri-chan completely ignored what I said.
◇◇◇
We went to the field and sat down on a bench in the shade.
“Hey, Riri-chan, let go of my hand.”
“No.”
“That’s not fair. What about the crêpe?”
The crêpe in Riri-chan’s right hand was just… hanging there.
“You’re going to eat it, Suzuna.”
“Then give it to me.”
And let go of my hand.
“Okay, here.”
Riri-chan extended her hand holding the crêpe.
Towards my mouth.
“…”
“What’s wrong? Aren’t you going to eat it?”
“I want to eat it, so please give it to me.”
“Just eat it like this.”
This is like feeding a pet.
“Come on, Suzuna, say ‘ahh.’”
“…Why do you always want to feed me, Riri-chan?”
This has happened a few times before. Riri-chan seems to like feeding me.
Even so, this is inefficient, and I want her to let go of my hand.
“Because it’s cute when you eat, Suzuna.”
She said something that didn’t make sense with a straight face.
“I’ll eat it normally.”
And let go of my hand.
“No. I won’t let go unless you say ‘ahh.’”
“You’re changing the rules.”
“I am.”
That’s unreasonable.
“I can feel your hand getting sweaty, Suzuna.”
“Stop it, seriously!”
I don’t usually sweat, but it’s hot outside, so I’m sweating even more.
The timing couldn’t be worse.
“Here you go.”
She brought the crêpe to my mouth.
The sweet scent of the crêpe wafted through the air.
…I guess it can’t be helped.
I gave up and took a bite.
The crêpe was thin and soft, the sweetness of the whipped cream and the fresh juiciness of the strawberries melting in my mouth.
I chewed and swallowed.
“Is it good?”
“…Yeah.”
What is she making me do?
“Here, eat more.”
She pushed the crêpe closer again.
“Are you planning on feeding me the whole thing…?”
“Just until it’s no longer sticking out of the wrapper.”
It’s just difficult for her to feed me after that, isn’t it?
…Well, it’s fine. It’ll be over soon.
I obediently took a few more bites.
“You have a small mouth, Suzuna.”
“…Don’t look.”
What is she staring at?
Anyway, the crêpe was no longer sticking out of the wrapper.
“See? It’s fine. Give me the rest.”
“Okay, okay, I guess it can’t be helped.”
It’s strange that it’s like I’m the one who compromised.
Riri-chan obediently handed me the crêpe.
“You should hold it with both hands, it’s going to fall apart.”
“Ah, okay.”
I took the crêpe with both hands, as instructed.
“You have some cream on your cheek, Suzuna.”
“Eh, really?”
I hesitated for a moment, wondering what to do since both my hands were occupied with the crêpe. That was my mistake.
“I’ll get it for you.”
“Eh…”
Riri-chan stood up from the bench and moved closer, her face near my cheek.
She could have just reached out, but she was strangely close.
—Lick
I felt her tongue against my cheek.
“Hey, Riri-chan!”
Riri-chan, still standing, looked away as she swirled her tongue around in her mouth.
She seemed to be savoring the cream. After a while, she finally looked at me.
“You’re sweet, Suzuna.”
“I’m not sweet! The cream is sweet!”
“Really? Then let me check if you’re really not sweet…”
Saying that, Riri-chan bent down and moved closer to my cheek again.
She’s going to lick my cheek again!
“Idiot!”
“Mmmgh!”
I retaliated by shoving the crêpe into Riri-chan’s mouth.
The wrapper got bent, but I think the crêpe reached her mouth.
“See? It tastes like crêpe, right?”
“…No, I think your cheek was sweeter, Suzuna.”
“You’re still saying that?!”
There was cream on Riri-chan’s cheek after she pulled away from the crêpe.
In that case…
“Oh, I got some on me too.”
Riri-chan noticed and scooped up the cream with her index finger.
“Riri-chan!”
“Whoa!”
I called out to her in a louder-than-usual voice, and she froze for a moment.
I stood up and put her index finger in my mouth.
“Eh?!”
I licked her finger clean.
“How’s that?”
“Suzuna…”
…Wait a minute.
Riri-chan seems… happy.
She’s grinning.
Isn’t this… backfiring?
“Ehehe.”
Ah, yeah, it is.
She’s enjoying it.
“So, Suzuna, how did my finger taste?”
…It was sweet.
84 Talking About the Future
After that, Riri-chan bought some yakisoba and onigiri and ate them normally.
“Suzuna, are you really okay with just a crêpe?”
“Ah, yeah…”
It was satisfying to watch Riri-chan eat so heartily.
“You were hungry, weren’t you, Riri-chan?”
“I was, but… you’re not thinking I’m eating too much, are you?”
Riri-chan gave me a look.
“I’m not. I was actually thinking of buying you something else since it didn’t seem like enough.”
“Don’t! Seriously, don’t!”
She stopped me with a serious tone.
“Ah, were you full?”
“The opposite, the opposite.”
“The opposite?”
“I can easily eat more, so I have to hold back.”
“…Ah.”
So that’s what she meant.
“You’re so lucky, Suzuna, being full from just a crêpe. You’re like a fairy tale creature.”
“No… there’s no such thing as a gloomy fairy tale creature.”
“Yes, there is. You’re cute, Suzuna.”
We’re talking about different things.
And she doesn’t have to call me cute every time, it makes me uncomfortable.
“I envy people who can eat a lot, like you, Riri-chan.”
“What’s so good about that…? You have no idea how much I struggle with this…”
Riri-chan sighed and swung her legs.
That childish gesture was cute.
“…Well, since we’ve eaten, should we check out the other projects?”
“Yeah.”
As we walked back to the school building, I noticed that Riri-chan was attracting attention from everyone we passed, regardless of their gender, year, or even if they were from another school.
She really is eye-catching.
“What’s wrong, Suzuna?”
Riri-chan immediately noticed my change in demeanor, even though I didn’t say anything.
She really can see right through me.
“Well, I just feel… out of place walking with you, Riri-chan.”
It’s become normal in the classroom, and I’ve gotten used to it, strangely enough.
But in a different environment, I’m reminded of how dazzling she is.
I think I’m less jealous now, but at the same time, I feel more insecure, like I’m not good enough for her.
Feelings are truly complicated.
“You’re overthinking it.”
“…I wonder.”
“You are.”
Riri-chan patted my head.
“And I’m more important than anyone else, right?”
“That’s… true, but…”
“Then it’s fine since I’m saying it’s fine.”
I wish it were that easy to just switch off my thoughts.
I’m not that strong.
I’m the type of person who keeps overthinking things.
“Come on, tell me if there’s anywhere you want to go.”
“Ah, okay…”
But that’s why…
Riri-chan, who leads me by the hand like this, might be the right person for me.
◇◇◇
Night fell.
The after-festival had begun, and there was a live band playing in the gymnasium.
Some people gathered there, while others chatted and relaxed in their favorite spots.
We were the latter, wandering the hallways together.
Being at school at night felt surreal and a little scary, but I also felt safe with Riri-chan by my side.
“Hey, Suzuna, what are you planning to do after graduation?”
Riri-chan suddenly asked.
“…I haven’t really thought about it.”
It’s only been about three months since I was reborn into this dating sim world.
I’ve been so preoccupied with the drastic changes in my life and the storyline that I haven’t thought about the future at all.
“We’re already second-years, so shouldn’t we start thinking about it?”
“I guess…”
No, that’s an excuse.
I haven’t thought about the future since I was the original Yukitsuki Mashiro.
I didn’t have anything I wanted to be, and I just chose a high school based on my grades, without any particular reason.
It was only natural for me to give up on a future that even my own parents weren’t interested in.
So I can’t think about what to do with my future.
“Are you thinking of going to college?”
“…I don’t know.”
I don’t have anything I want to study in college.
And I don’t have a specific career in mind either…
“My parents are telling me to go to college.”
“I see.”
Even though Riri-chan isn’t a top student, Seiran Academy is a preparatory school.
She’ll probably be able to get into a college somewhere.
“But I don’t want to leave this city, so I’m thinking of going to a nearby university.”
“…Hmm.”
I envy her for being able to decide so clearly.
I can’t even make that decision.
“Haven’t your parents said anything, Suzuna?”
“Not really… they said I can do what I want.”
Amatsuki Suzuna has a memory of her parents telling her that.
“Then let’s go to the same university.”
“…Eh?”
That was an unexpected suggestion.
“Well, even if it’s not the same one… this city is pretty big, so there are a lot of universities. You should also go to a university in this area, Suzuna. I can work hard to match your academic level.”
Riri-chan said that with a serious expression.
“…Why?”
“Why? Because I want to be with you, Suzuna.”
“With me…”
“I don’t want a job so badly that I’d defy my parents, and if I go to college, I can spend time with you, Suzuna. Don’t you think it’s a good idea?”
…This is the first time…
Someone has cared about my future.
Someone has wished for a future with me.
“…It might be a good idea.”
“Right? Then let’s think about it.”
Just having someone like that gives me a sense of direction.
I felt like I could decide on a path, a path to a future with Riri-chan.
“Thank you, Riri-chan.”
“It’s nothing to be thankful for. It’s mutual.”
Riri-chan probably says that because she doesn’t know.
Only Riri-chan can save me from the loneliness that has always been with me.
—Bang
A burst of light flashed through the window, accompanied by an explosive sound.
Fireworks.
“Ahaha, perfect timing! It’s like they’re celebrating our future, isn’t it?”
Riri-chan looked up at the fireworks blooming in the night sky.
I thought her profile was much more beautiful than the fireworks.
------------------ 
85 Before Falling Asleep
“The fireworks are over.”
The fireworks, the next most beautiful thing after Riri-chan, ended abruptly.
That’s to be expected from school-scale fireworks.
“Yeah. Our cultural festival is over too.”
That signaled the end of the after-festival.
We joined the crowd leaving the school.
After walking for a while, the presence of others faded away.
“I heard from Kaede earlier that the number of couples who started dating because of the cultural festival has exploded.”
What an awkward topic.
“H-Hmm…”
“Last year, I was annoyed, thinking, ‘Starting to date at the cultural festival? So cliché,’ but this year, I can listen to it calmly.”
But Riri-chan’s next words surprised me.
“Even you get annoyed by that kind of thing, Riri-chan?”
Romance is like a fairy tale to me, so unrealistic that I don’t feel anything.
My heart naturally shuts down, maybe.
“Of course! It’s not like I like being single.”
Well, that’s probably true, considering Riri-chan’s social circle…
But I still felt a sense of dissonance.
“You could have started dating someone if you wanted to, Riri-chan.”
After all, countless people confess to Hinase Riri.
She’s incredibly popular.
“Hmm… well, none of them felt… right.”
“Felt right…?”
After rejecting so many handsome guys, the only one who felt “right” was me…?
Even I think that’s strange.
“…Well, since it’s you, Suzuna, I’ll tell you. I’m not very good with… boys.”
That was also news to me.
“Really?”
“Yeah, it’s not like I hate them or anything. It’s just… they’re not… romantically appealing to me…”
“…I see.”
So that’s why…
That’s why Riri-chan is the only heroine who doesn’t interact with Shindo-kun.
I’m sure there’s a reason for that, but it’s not something I should pry into.
“Ah, but it’s not like I’m… interested in girls either. I just thought… maybe I’m not capable of romantic feelings.”
But she ends up with Shindo-kun in the original story, so what is he, some kind of love guru?
If I hadn’t snatched his route, he might be the one walking next to me right now.
Thinking about that, it really was a fateful crossroads.
“We’re alike.”
I expressed my sympathy, not just because of that, but because I don’t want to let Riri-chan go.
“You and me?”
“Yeah, I also thought I wasn’t the type to have… those kinds of relationships.”
I thought I’d live my life alone.
“You’re the one who changed that, Suzuna.”
“…Me? I didn’t do anything.”
I don’t remember doing anything that significant.
“Yes, you did.”
“Whoa!”
Riri-chan suddenly clung to my arm.
“It’s fine, we’re… in that kind of relationship now.”
Riri-chan quickly added, sensing my impending objection.
I couldn’t argue with that.
“Well, let’s not get into the details. I want to cherish the time we have together.”
Riri-chan casually said something incredibly cheesy.
I, unfortunately, don’t possess that kind of straightforwardness.
“Yeah.”
So I’ll at least nod in agreement.
Because I feel the same way.
◇◇◇
I arrived home.
The room was dark. I flipped the switch, and the lights came on.
It’s something I do every day without thinking, but today, it felt… different, a strange loneliness.
It’s probably because of everything that happened today.
“I should get ready for bed…”
It was still early, but I was tired from all the unfamiliar activities.
Sleepiness was quickly approaching.
◇◇◇
“Haa…”
—Thump
I landed on the bed.
As my body relaxed, I realized how tired I was.
…But this might be the first time…
The cultural festival was always an event that reminded me of how out of place I was, not the wonderful experience everyone claimed it to be.
So I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much today.
Moreover, I even felt… sad that it was over.
I never thought there would be a day when I wished it would continue.
“You feel the same way, don’t you?”
I spoke to the two penguins lying next to me.
They didn’t reply, but their gentle silhouettes remained unchanged.
“…Huh?”
Looking closely, I noticed a slight difference in their size.
The gray one was slightly smaller than the blue one.
“…You’re like… Riri-chan and me.”
Riri-chan is colorful and tall, while I’m… grayish, I’m not even sure if I have a color, and I feel… small.
Maybe I’m thinking that because this is a present from Riri-chan.
I’m lonely without Riri-chan, but these little ones she gave me offer a small comfort.
They make me feel like Riri-chan is here.
“…”
Both penguins were lying on their backs on my bed.
It felt a little lonely that they were both staring at the ceiling, even though they were together.
I turned the penguins on their sides, so they were facing each other.
I also made their flippers intertwine.
“…There. You’re not lonely anymore, right?”
There’s no reason for these close penguin friends to ignore each other.
It’s much better for them to be together like this.
Embracing each other…
“N-No, I shouldn’t. It’s too early for you two.”
I felt like I was making them do something inappropriate and turned the penguins back onto their backs.
I felt embarrassed, even though no one was watching.
I shouldn’t have imagined them as Riri-chan and me.
Thinking about them embracing each other was a mistake.
It made me remember what happened in the music room today.
The unfinished… encounter with Riri-chan.
The feeling of her lips, the pain of her bite on my ear, the sensation of her hand on my leg.
My Secret Place, which she almost touched…
Everything was new, and everything was stimulating.
I don’t have the courage to initiate that kind of thing.
But since we’re dating now, we’ll probably… do that kind of thing.
I can’t imagine what will happen to me then.
“…I should sleep.”
I lay on my back, imitating the penguins.
I wonder if Riri-chan will sleep next to me like these little ones someday.
That thought made me feel embarrassed again.
86 What It Means to Me: Hinase Riri’s Side
“Morning…”
The annoying sound of my phone alarm woke me up.
Today is the day for cleaning up after the cultural festival.
“…Such a pain.”
I don’t feel like cleaning up after the festival at all.
Because yesterday was filled with dreamlike events.
It’s like a dream that Suzuna and I are dating now.
But I’m afraid that once the school is cleaned up and everything is back to normal, I’ll wake up from this dream.
I wish the dream would continue.
“But I have to do what I have to do…”
I don’t like doing troublesome things, but I’m aiming for university.
I don’t want to reduce my attendance or lower my grades by skipping school.
Since I’m not academically gifted, I don’t want to be held back by other factors.
“‘Then why don’t you stop wearing makeup and wear your uniform properly?’”
Kaede said that sarcastically.
But that’s one thing, this is another.
I can’t be myself if I stop caring about my appearance.
And if I can’t be myself, I won’t be able to go to school, so it’s necessary.
“‘I was stupid to even listen to you.’”
Kaede dismissed me with those words.
I know it’s contradictory, but I can’t help it; that’s just how I feel.
I got out of bed and went to the living room.
The living room window is large.
There are almost no buildings in front of it, offering a view overlooking the city.
It’s a spectacular view, I guess.
But I see it every day alone, so I don’t feel anything anymore.
“It’s boring to see anything alone, anyway.”
That being said, I think I’m quite privileged.
I’m not bragging, but people compliment my appearance.
And I live a comfortable life.
My dad only told me to “graduate from university,” he hasn’t said anything else.
He lets me live in this high-rise apartment and hasn’t come home for years because of his work.
I know I’m living a carefree life, a life that’s impossible for most high school students.
But I’ve always felt like something was missing.
◇◇◇
My mom died when I was born.
I’ll never know what a mother figure is like.
So my family consists of my dad and my older brother, and my concept of “men” is shaped by them.
My brother is much older than me, and he got married and left home soon after I became aware of things.
And my dad is always away from home because of his work.
That relationship shaped my common sense.
The common sense that men naturally leave me.
It’s a difficult feeling to shake off.
They flatter me with sweet words, but they’ll eventually disappear from my life.
Thinking that, I couldn’t bring myself to truly love anyone.
So even though I have friends, I thought I could never truly be with someone.
“But then…”
One girl completely changed my sense of loneliness.
◇◇◇
I waited for Suzuna at our usual meeting spot.
This is our first morning as a couple, so I’m a little nervous.
I wonder if I can act normal…
“G-Good morning, R-Riri-chan…”
Suzuna appeared, looking even more nervous than me, so my nervousness quickly dissipated.
“What’s wrong, Suzuna? Can’t you even say good morning anymore?”
I peered into Suzuna’s face, forcing her to make eye contact.
“I just did.”
“You stuttered.”
“Everyone stutters sometimes.”
“That’s true. You like biting, don’t you?”
Suzuna’s expression turned visibly sullen at those words.
“…You’re talking about different kinds of biting, aren’t you?”
“Hmm? What do you mean?”
“…You’re using the word ‘bite’ in two different ways.”
“Ah, you mean this?”
I pretended not to understand and pointed at my inner thigh, over my skirt.
There was still a clear mark where Suzuna bit me.
“It’s fine, I let you bite me.”
Suzuna’s expression turned defiant, and she sniffled.
“…Which meaning?”
“Both.”
Saying words is one thing, but most people don’t like being bitten physically.
“It’s fine with me. Either way.”
But I’m okay with it.
I can endure a little pain for the cute Suzuna.
“…You want to be bitten?”
Suzuna seemed momentarily taken aback, probably not expecting me to agree.
“If that’s what you want, Suzuna. It’s fine.”
“…That’s… not very interesting.”
“Not interesting?”
What’s with that response?
“Yeah, it’s better to bite someone who doesn’t want to be bitten.”
Suzuna casually says things that make me question her character.
I think it’s strange that I’m okay with being bitten, but it’s also strange that Suzuna wants to bite me when I don’t want to be bitten.
“That’s your way of showing affection, Suzuna, right? Of course, I’ll accept it.”
“…That’s not what I’m doing.”
I know Suzuna will deny it when I say that.
Knowing that, I often phrase things this way to see her reaction.
“Then what does it mean?”
“Stress relief.”
“You’re taking advantage of my willingness to accept it and biting me to relieve your stress. That’s still a form of affection.”
“…That’s how you interpret it.”
“Is there any other interpretation?”
Suzuna might be unaware of it, but I think that’s what she means.
“Since when have you been thinking that way?”
“Pretty much from the beginning?”
“…So you’ve been biting me multiple times, thinking it was a sign of affection from the beginning? You really are strange, Riri-chan.”
Of course, I didn’t think it was romantic love.
But I thought it was a sign of affection, at least.
“No, no, you’re the strange one for biting people so many times.”
“…Anyway, that’s not why I bite you. Don’t think about weird things.”
Suzuna started walking ahead.
She’s probably embarrassed, realizing what I said.
She’s so cute.
“Suzuna, wait for me.”
“I won’t.”
I quickened my pace and caught up to Suzuna.
“…By the way…”
“What?”
Suzuna’s demeanor changed slightly.
I sensed a certain resolve, like she had made up her mind about something.
“What do you like, Riri-chan?”
I didn’t expect such a basic question at this time.
Is she testing me?
“Well…”
I decided to tell her the first thing that came to mind.
“You, Suzuna.”
“…”
Suzuna’s eyes widened.
“Answer me seriously.”
“I am being serious.”
Suzuna started walking faster.
I sped up too.
Unfortunately for her, I’m more athletic, so I can easily keep up.
“Riri-chan, it’s morning, so let’s have a normal conversation.”
“Why? It’s fine. We’re not just friends anymore.”
I think this is okay since our relationship has deepened.
“That’s exactly why I want you to act normal!”
“Eh? Then it’s no different from before.”
I want to cherish our changed relationship.
I want to feel closer to Suzuna, who told me she likes me.
“It’s… different because we’re not just friends anymore, it’s… real. It’s too stimulating.”
“…Suzuna, you’re usually so cynical, and then you’re suddenly so pure.”
“Shut up.”
“You’re cute.”
“I said, shut up!”
Suzuna is trying to distance herself from me now, but even so, she’s someone I want to chase.
I think this is what it means to like someone.
------------------ 
87 Wanting to Know Your Preferences
The cheerful alarm on my phone woke me up in the morning.
The music alone irritated me, a stark contrast to my mood.
“I’m so sleepy…”
Maybe it’s because I was thinking strange things about the penguin plushies last night.
Or maybe it’s because I was so excited about the cultural festival with Riri-chan.
Anyway, I couldn’t sleep at all.
“It’s probably both…”
And today is the day for cleaning up after the cultural festival.
I don’t feel like doing it at all; my motivation is zero.
But I might be able to go about it more lightheartedly than previous cultural festivals.
Thanks to Riri-chan.
“…Hmm? Riri-chan?”
Thinking about her made me realize something.
I feel like I’m forgetting something important.
I opened the calendar app on my phone and checked this month’s schedule.
July 21st: Riri-chan’s birthday.
“…Ah.”
It was only three days away.
◇◇◇
Just to be clear, I didn’t forget.
Since I remembered it naturally like this, it’s been on my mind.
It’s just that things have been hectic lately, with the sports festival, my birthday, and the cultural festival.
So I was just… tired from all the changes.
“Or rather, that’s not the main issue…”
Thinking about it calmly, this is our first morning and commute to school as a couple.
I’m a little nervous.
Seeing Riri-chan’s glamorous silhouette from afar made my heart race.
“Calm down, calm down, me…”
I told myself.
It’s okay, I just have to act normal.
“G-Good morning, R-Riri-chan…”
The worst.
I stuttered badly.
My weakness under pressure was on full display.
Look, Riri-chan’s expression is… smug.
“What’s wrong, Suzuna? Can’t you even say good morning anymore?”
She peered into my face with a teasing smile.
She’s beautiful, but her face is also annoying right now.
I’ll bite her face if she does that again.
Yes, that’s what I’ll do. I’ve decided.
“I just did.”
“You stuttered.”
“Everyone stutters sometimes.”
“That’s true. You like biting, don’t you?”
…She’s seeing right through me.
Riri-chan always sees through me, but it feels like her accuracy is increasing, and it’s starting to scare me.
It’s like I can’t hide anything from her.
After that, she kept teasing me about biting her, so I decided to leave her behind.
“Suzuna, wait for me.”
“I won’t.”
Riri-chan followed me.
Thinking about it calmly, there’s no way I can outrun Riri-chan, who’s more athletic.
So I’ll just give up.
There’s something more important.
I have no idea what to get Riri-chan for her birthday.
So I have no choice but to ask her directly.
“What do you like, Riri-chan?”
Riri-chan looked surprised.
W-Was my question too blunt…?
She’ll probably figure out it’s about her birthday.
It’s not a secret, but it’s not something I’d openly announce either.
Riri-chan gave me the penguins without saying anything.
“Well…”
Riri-chan suddenly became serious and thought about it.
What? Is that something you have to think about?
I thought it was something you’d answer casually.
“You, Suzuna.”
“…”
Seriously…
Stop with those jokes in the morning.
I can’t even look at you.
I decided to run away from Riri-chan, even though I knew it was futile.
◇◇◇
“I wish the school would burn down.”
As I was removing the maid cafe decorations in the classroom, someone made an arsonist-like remark.
“Hey, Suzuna, wouldn’t it be great if the school burned down?”
And it was Shindo-kun.
He seemed to have called out to me, the closest person, since no one else responded to him.
How annoying.
“…Shindo-kun, stop messing around and get to work.”
“How can you say that? Since the beginning of our second year, this is the moment I’ve been the most seriously troubled.”
What are you talking about?
Someone, please get this creepy guy away from me.
“Why do you think that?”
“Because this school is unhealthy.”
“…”
Coming from the person who’s supposed to embody the epitome of unhealthiness—a harem—that doesn’t sound very convincing…
“Hey, stop looking at me with those pitying eyes. We’re in the same boat, you know.”
I don’t care about anything else, but I find it offensive to be categorized with Shindo-kun.
“In the same boat? How?”
“Don’t make me say it. We’re both… single, aren’t we?”
“…Hmm?”
“The number of couples has exploded since the cultural festival started.”
“Apparently.”
“We’re… immune to that lovey-dovey stuff, aren’t we?”
“…I see.”
He brought up a topic that was difficult to respond to.
“Hey, don’t freeze up. It’s a well-known fact.”
“Uh, y-yeah…”
“We’re both leftovers, so let’s get along.”
“…Hmm.”
I’ll remain noncommittal.
“Hmm? Hey, Suzuna… that reaction… don’t tell me…”
“Eh?”
He’s strangely perceptive.
I wish he wouldn’t use his childhood friend advantage at times like these.
“Do you have a… boyfriend?”
“…”
That’s a subtle miss, as expected of the oblivious protagonist.
“…No, I don’t.”
I wasn’t lying.
“Don’t scare me like that! I thought you left me behind!”
“It’s fine… even if you leave me behind, Shindo-kun.”
“We’re stuck together, I won’t abandon you.”
“…Hmm.”
I don’t need this connection.
He should be talking to the other heroines, not me.
I didn’t interfere with Shindo-kun’s cultural festival events, and as expected, nothing happened.
He’s still single.
What to do about the ending with him…
It’s a problem I have to face, but I’m not in the right headspace for that right now.
“Hey, while we’re at it, I have a question.”
“Oh, what is it?”
“What would you like to receive for your birthday?”
“…Hmm, let me see.”
Shindo-kun put his hand on his chin and thought about it.
“Infinite love.”
“…”
So he does want a girlfriend.
88 A Matter of Consultation
“A birthday present? For Amatsuki Suzuna?”
I was walking down the hallway to throw away the cardboard boxes we used for the maid cafe decorations when I happened to run into Shindo Kokona-chan.
I don’t have many people I can consult with… or rather, almost none, so I decided to ask Kokona-chan.
She seemed surprised, her voice rising an octave.
“Yeah, what do you think I should get her?”
“What do you mean, ‘what should I get her?’… That depends on the person.”
A perfectly reasonable opinion.
“Y-Yeah…”
“Who is it? It’s unusual for you to give a present to anyone other than Onii-chan.”
The fact that Shindo-kun is automatically excluded shows that Kokona-chan’s understanding of me has improved considerably.
“It’s Riri-chan’s birthday.”
“Well, obviously.”
Kokona-chan didn’t seem particularly surprised, as if it was within her expectations.
“Why are you even dating Hinase Riri…?”
“Eh?”
D-Dating…?
H-How does Kokona-chan know…?!
“What? You’re always together, acting all friendly.”
“Ah, you mean… that…”
That was close.
I almost self-destructed.
“It doesn’t make sense for you to be surprised when I’m trying to give her a birthday present.”
“Yes, you’re absolutely right.”
Kokona-chan is always harsh with me.
“So, Kokona-chan, do you have any good ideas?”
“How would I know what that girl likes?”
“…Right.”
“You’re the one who knows her, aren’t you?”
“Well, that’s the thing, I don’t really know…”
Even when I tried to think about it, I didn’t really know what Riri-chan likes.
“You’re so insensitive. You should know that much if you’re close.”
Kokona-chan’s words pierced my heart.
“…You’re right.”
We’re more than friends now; we’re dating.
Even I think my understanding of her is lacking.
Riri-chan tries to get to know me, but maybe I’ve been taking her for granted.
“You haven’t done enough research. You’re supposed to do that beforehand.”
“…Yes.”
“If you don’t know, just ask her directly.”
“…I guess that’s my last resort.”
“So you’re not planning on asking her directly?”
“No…”
Riri-chan tried to figure out my preferences and gave me a present.
So if possible, I want to do the same for her.
“Well… then try to subtly ask Hinase Riri and find out.”
“Yeah, I’ll do that. Thanks, Kokona-chan.”
I have to thank Kokona-chan for making me realize my shortcomings.
“…It’s just common sense. Don’t thank me for something like this.”
Kokona-chan sniffled and walked away.
I’m getting scolded even for thanking her.
Human relationships are difficult.
◇◇◇
The garbage disposal area is outside the school building.
I changed from my indoor shoes to loafers and walked past the main gate.
All the while, I kept thinking about Riri-chan’s birthday present.
Riri-chan’s preferences…
Even if I try to subtly ask her, she’ll probably see right through my lack of taste.
I’m starting to think I have no choice but to ask her directly…
“Oh, it’s here.”
I almost walked past the garbage disposal area.
That was close.
“The door is open.”
Is another student here?
Should I come back later?
It’s awkward to be in a closed space with someone I don’t know.
Yeah, that’s what I’ll do.
I turned around.
“Oh, Suzuna-chan. Are you here to throw out the garbage too?”
A familiar voice called out to me.
“…Futaba-senpai.”
“Hello, what a coincidence.”
Futaba-senpai waved.
“Are you thinking about something?”
“Eh…”
How did she know?
“You almost walked past the garbage disposal area while holding a cardboard box, and then you were about to walk in the opposite direction.”
…She saw everything.
From an objective perspective, I do look suspicious.
“W-Well… just a little…”
“What’s wrong?”
…Hmm.
I feel like I already reached a conclusion after talking to Kokona-chan, but…
It wouldn’t hurt to hear another person’s opinion.
“I’m thinking about… what to get my friend for her birthday.”
“Ah, that girl, huh?”
Senpai is quick to pick up on things.
“I was wondering what would be a good present.”
“Hmm, hmm, then why don’t you give her… yourself, Suzuna-chan?”
“…Excuse me?”
Her Japanese suddenly became strange.
“Like… tie a ribbon around yourself and say, ‘I’m your present!’… or something?”
“Or something?! Who would be happy with that?”
“I think she would be…?”
I definitely chose the wrong person to consult with.
“Ah, well, I would accept it.”
“…Don’t talk about people like they’re objects.”
“Well, in this case, ‘myself’ as a present means… that, you know?”
“What do you mean?”
“Offering your body.”
“…Um, so that’s like…”
That sounds… suggestive.
“Like… friends with benefits?”
I knew it!
“It’s not ‘like’ that.”
“I’m sure she’d be happy. That girl would.”
“That’s not what I meant!”
“…Isn’t it?”
“It’s not!”
“…Oh, my mistake.”
She walked past me, not seeming particularly bothered.
“Well, even if it’s not that kind of relationship… you could definitely win her over with that, Suzuna-chan.”
“What are you even talking about?”
Futaba-senpai is an enigma.
◇◇◇
“I’m telling you, I’ll do it even if you don’t tell me to!”
“Then do it. Now.”
When I returned to the classroom, Riri-chan and Kanaori Reika were glaring at each other.
The atmosphere was tense.
“Apparently, our class is lagging behind in the cleanup. And when Kanaori came to help, Riri started complaining.”
“Ah, I see…”
Tachibana-san explained the situation to me since I was confused.
It’s quite rare for her to talk to me.
“We put a lot of effort into decorating the maid cafe, so it’s only natural that cleaning up will take time.”
“That’s why I came to help.”
“We don’t need your help. You should take care of your own class.”
“My class is already finished.”
“That was fast.”
“I planned the cleanup in advance, so it was finished quickly.”
As expected of Kanaori-san.
She’s too efficient, planning not only the setup but also the cleanup.
“Anyway, this class is significantly behind schedule. There might be complaints if the dismissal time varies too much. Please follow my instructions.”
“We don’t need you. I can’t concentrate with you here.”
“I wasn’t expecting anything from someone who lacks concentration in the first place.”
“That’s too much!”
“It’s a fair assessment.”
They continued to bicker.
Since it was a confrontation between the gal and the student council president, two of the most beautiful girls in Seiran Academy, no one dared to intervene…
“Hey, Amatsuki, do something about that.”
Tachibana-san casually pushed the difficult task onto me.
“Me?”
“You’re the only one who’s close to both of them, Amatsuki.”
So that’s why she approached me…
She’s sly…
But I can’t refuse when asked…
“U-Um… you two…”
I hesitantly stepped between them.
“Suzuna, listen to what this girl is—”
“Amatsuki-san, listen to what this girl is—”
They both started talking to me at the same time, then glared at each other again.
“Suzuna came to talk to me. Not you.”
“Amatsuki-san said ‘both of you,’ so that includes me. Has your comprehension also deteriorated?”
This is impossible.
------------------ 
89 When Feelings Run High
“Honestly, what is with that girl?”
In the end, since Riri-chan and Kanaori-san would fight whenever they were together, I had them work separately.
Once we made some progress, we decided that the rest of the cleanup could be handled by the class, and I saw Kanaori-san off.
Everyone was intimidated by Kanaori-san, so I naturally ended up escorting her to the hallway.
“Suzuna, you’re supposed to be over here!”
Just as I thought that, Riri-chan’s angry voice called out from behind me, but…
“Come on, the cleanup went really well thanks to Kanaori, so just be quiet.”
“That’s different from Suzuna!”
“Fine, fine, if you don’t be quiet, I’ll post pictures of you in your maid outfit all over social media.”
“What?! When did you even…?”
Tachibana-san was placating Riri-chan.
I overheard something I couldn’t ignore, but I’ll leave it to Riri-chan, who was vehemently protesting.
“Thank you for your help, Kanaori-san.”
I bowed my head in the hallway.
Thanks to her, it seems like we’ll finish within the allotted time.
“No, I just did what was necessary. Don’t worry about it, Amatsuki-san.”
As expected of Kanaori-san, she’s so magnanimous.
“By the way, did things work out with… the matter you consulted me about during the cultural festival?”
“Ah, um, well…”
That’s right.
I confided in Kanaori-san during the cultural festival, and she told me it was romantic love I felt for Riri-chan.
“Yes… thanks to you, it… somehow worked out.”
I’m not sure if it’s okay to tell Kanaori-san this.
But I can’t just not answer after she listened to my worries.
“I see. That’s good.”
Contrary to my anxiety, Kanaori-san smiled.
Maybe she’s genuinely happy for me.
“It’s thanks to you, Kanaori-san. Thank you.”
“No, I didn’t do anything. And I won’t pry, but please… conduct yourselves appropriately at school. I don’t want to have to reprimand you, Amatsuki-san.”
“Ah, yes, we’ll be careful.”
She’s so understanding and mature…
“If you have any other concerns, please feel free to consult me.”
Kanaori-san turned to leave, but—
“Um, can I ask you one more thing?”
“Yes, certainly. But that was… quicker than I expected.”
She turned around in surprise, as if caught off guard.
“Um… I want to give that person a birthday present, but what do you think I should get her?”
“A present…? Honestly, I don’t have any experience with that, so I can’t offer any specific advice…”
Kanaori-san pondered, even as she said that.
“Of course, everyone has their preferences, but if it’s something you choose with genuine care, Amatsuki-san, I’m sure she’ll be happy with anything.”
“Anything…?”
“Yes. If someone can only be happy receiving something they specifically asked for, then they’re probably narrow-minded. If they truly care about you, they should appreciate your feelings, Amatsuki-san, and the effort you put into choosing the present.”
“I see…”
I might be being presumptuous, but I think Riri-chan would accept anything I give her with a smile.
So it’s not about the gift itself, but the thought behind it.
“But I can’t compare to your experience in that area, Amatsuki-san, so please disregard what I said.”
“N-No! Not at all! Thank you very much!”
“I’m glad I could be of help. Well then…”
This time, Kanaori-san really left.
“Suzuna! Forget about her and come back here!”
“Ah, yes! I’m back!”
Urged by Riri-chan’s irritated voice, I returned to the classroom.
◇◇◇
“Ah, finally, it’s over.”
Riri-chan stretched widely.
The cleanup after the cultural festival was finished, and we were walking home together, as usual.
“Y-Yeah.”
“There was more heavy lifting than I expected. The boys went overboard with the decorations.”
“That’s true.”
“Well, thanks to that, we apparently had the highest sales, so I guess it was worth it…”
“I see.”
“Suzuna?”
“Yeah, definitely.”
“…Hello?”
“I know, it happens.”
“…Hey, are you even listening to me?!”
“Ouch!”
Riri-chan flicked my forehead.
And it was pretty hard.
“Why are you spacing out?”
“Ah, I wasn’t spacing out…”
“You were. We weren’t even having a conversation.”
Ah, was I…?
I was a little nervous, so my mind was elsewhere.
“What’s wrong? Do you have something on your mind?”
“Well, not really a problem, but…”
I’m just trying to work up the courage to tell you.
I’m so nervous about preparing myself mentally.
“What is it? Come on, tell me. Your girlfriend will listen to anything.”
“O-Okay, just don’t say it like that.”
Emphasizing “girlfriend” makes it even harder to say.
“Ah, there’s a park over there. Let’s talk there.”
“Uh, y-yeah…”
A park, a splash of green, a sudden break from the concrete jungle of the residential area.
It wasn’t large, but the feeling of being separated from the surrounding space was somewhat calming.
We sat down on a bench under the trees.
“So, what’s wrong?”
Riri-chan asked, crossing her legs.
“Um, well, Riri-chan, your birthday is… coming up soon, right…?”
“Yeah, it is.”
“That day… I want to celebrate with you.”
“Okay, and?”
Riri-chan immediately uncrossed her legs and moved closer.
This might be an acceptable distance for lovers, but I don’t think it’s appropriate in public.
“I was wondering if you’re… free…”
“Suzuna, did you forget?”
“Eh, what…?”
“I told you I’d clear my schedule for you, Suzuna.”
“Ah, yeah… but I was wondering if it was really okay…”
I’ve never celebrated anyone’s birthday before, so I’m nervous about asking.
I think it’ll be fine, but I’d be worried if she refused.
“Of course it’s okay! I’ll be with you, of course. I’m looking forward to it!”
“H-Hey, Riri-chan!”
Riri-chan snuggled up to me and even rubbed her cheek against mine.
Riri-chan’s skin is so smooth, it feels nice, but…
I’m more flustered by the closeness than the sensation.
“What if someone sees us?”
“It’s okay, no one’s around.”
It’s true that no one was around, but we’re still in a park.
Someone could come by at any time.
“Besides, you want to be seen, don’t you, Suzuna?”
“No, that’s…”
I can’t deny it…
But that doesn’t mean I should just admit it…
“What should we do? Kiss?”
“Huh? …Wh-Why so suddenly?”
“Because I’m happy you invited me, Suzuna.”
“Well, that’s only natural…”
“Then it’s also natural for lovers to kiss.”
“Ugh…”
That’s not fair.
“So, is it okay?”
“…It’s neither good nor bad.”
Riri-chan’s hands cupped my cheeks.
Her hands held my face in place, forcing me to meet her gaze.
“If you want to refuse, just push my hands away.”
That’s unnecessary.
She knows I won’t do that.
Riri-chan is making sure I’m consenting.
Riri-chan’s fingers tightened slightly.
Her warmth reached me, and then our lips met.
The third kiss felt much more… real than the first time.
Riri-chan’s lips moved against mine, as if to envelop them.
Then I felt something touch my tongue.
“Mmn…!”
A wet, slippery sensation.
Riri-chan’s tongue touched mine.
It traced my tongue, as if licking it.
Wh-What is this…?
As if sensing my surprise, Riri-chan pulled away.
“Riri-chan, what are you doing?”
“Eh…? A lover’s kiss…?”
“I-I didn’t know you were going to do that!”
“Well, it’s not something you’d say out loud, is it? And your face is bright red, Suzuna.”
Her cheeks were also red, even as she said that.
I wasn’t prepared for that, so I was surprised.
“If you’re going to do something new, tell me beforehand!”
“That’s too much to ask…”
“Tell me!”
“Well… it depends on the mood, doesn’t it?”
Apparently, my invitation made Riri-chan very excited.
I’m already flustered just from inviting her, so it’s unfair of her to make me even more flustered.
90 Just the Two of Us: Hinase Riri’s Side
Today is a school holiday, making up for the cultural festival.
And it’s Riri-chan’s birthday.
“It’s so hot…”
We decided to celebrate at Riri-chan’s house, so I walked there wearing denim pants, a T-shirt, and a backpack.
The end of July is the peak of summer heat.
“I see, that’s why Riri-chan is always so energetic, because she was born in this season. It must be.”
I entertained that illogical thought.
Is this heat really just from the temperature, or is it because I’m nervous about Riri-chan’s birthday?
I couldn’t tell.
Anyway, I somehow endured the heat and arrived in front of Riri-chan’s apartment building.
I rang the intercom.
“Coming!”
A cheerful voice came through the speaker, and the automatic door lock disengaged.
It was much cooler inside the entrance than outside.
I took the elevator to Riri-chan’s floor.
I rang the intercom at her door.
—Click
The door opened.
“Suzuna, you made it!”
“Eh?”
Riri-chan jumped at me as soon as the door opened.
Or rather, she hugged me.
I quickly stepped inside and closed the door.
“What if the neighbors saw us?”
“You’re always so worried about what other people think, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan was wearing shorts and a T-shirt.
Being so close to her, with so much skin exposed, made me flustered.
“It would be troublesome if they looked at us strangely.”
“Strangely how?”
“Well… if they thought we were… that kind of couple…”
“We are that kind of couple, so it’s fine, isn’t it?”
Please don’t say that while your arms are around my neck.
This closeness fuels unwanted imaginations.
“And won’t people find out eventually?”
“I… wonder…”
“They will. Because you’ll be with me forever, Suzuna.”
“Ugh…”
Riri-chan casually says things that make me embarrassed.
“Well, I don’t intend to hide it anyway.”
She says the most outrageous things so nonchalantly.
“You don’t?”
“No. It would be impossible to keep it a secret forever, wouldn’t it?”
Is that so…? Maybe…
“Well, I won’t be open about it as long as you want to keep it a secret, Suzuna. But that day will come eventually.”
“That’s true…”
I’m a little scared of people finding out that we’re dating.
Partly because we’re both girls.
But more than that, I don’t think I’m good enough for Riri-chan.
I feel embarrassed.
“Well, that doesn’t matter now. Come on in.”
Riri-chan took my hand.
“Ah, okay.”
I entered her apartment.
“Aren’t you hot wearing denim pants?”
Riri-chan looked me up and down and said that as soon as I entered.
She seems to have an issue with my outfit.
“I am, but… this is all I have.”
“Of course you’re hot. Why don’t you wear a skirt or shorts, Suzuna?”
“No way, I don’t want to show my legs.”
“That’s a waste. You have nice legs, Suzuna.”
I’m happy to hear that, but…
“You’re the only one who says that, Riri-chan.”
“Well, no one else has seen them. You change so quickly at school, Suzuna.”
“Because I don’t want to be seen.”
And I also change when there are fewer people around, so the chances of being seen are quite low.
“Well, that’s fine. It makes you feel like… you’re only mine, Suzuna.”
Seemingly satisfied, Riri-chan brought over a tray with glasses.
“This is iced tea.”
“Ah, sorry. I’m making you do everything on your birthday…”
“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s nothing.”
She placed the glasses on the low table.
Riri-chan sat down in front of the bed, and I thought, “Now’s the time,” and steeled my resolve.
I rummaged through my backpack and took out what I bought.
“Here, it’s cake and some other sweets.”
I handed her the box with the shop’s name written in cursive.
“Oh! I was wondering why your backpack was so big.”
Riri-chan’s eyes widened as she accepted the box.
“And this is from that new shop that opened near the station, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, I heard it’s good.”
It’s based on online reviews.
Sorry if they were fake.
“Wow, thanks, Suzuna. It must have been hard to buy all this.”
“Well… it was a bit crowded.”
It was a painful crowd of fashionable people, a nightmare for someone with social anxiety.
I would never go there if it wasn’t for Riri-chan’s birthday.
“I bought a variety, so choose whichever one you like.”
I bought a lot since I don’t know her preferences.
This is another time when I’m reminded of how little I know about Riri-chan.
I’m sure she wouldn’t hesitate this much if she were choosing something for me.
“Okay, thanks.”
Riri-chan picked up a slice of cheesecake and put it on a plate.
“You like cheesecake?”
“Yeah, I think I like it.”
“I see. What else?”
“Anything is fine.”
No, I’m sure there are other things she likes.
“What do you like the most?”
“Eh, let me see…”
She glanced at the contents of the box.
She’s hesitating because it’s probably not in there.
I think she’s avoiding saying it because she doesn’t want to make me feel bad.
Riri-chan is always so subtly considerate of me.
“It’s okay even if it’s not in here.”
“Okay, hmm…”
Riri-chan made a troubled expression, then reluctantly spoke.
“Mont Blanc, I guess.”
“Hmm…”
As expected, it wasn’t among the things I bought.
And I also realized that she likes sweets that aren’t too sweet. That’s unexpected.
“Ah, but I like cheesecake just as much!”
Riri-chan added quickly, as if trying to reassure me.
She doesn’t have to worry about that.
But this is fine.
I want to know more about Riri-chan.
“That was delicious.”
“Yeah.”
Riri-chan and I ate the cake while chatting, as usual.
There were still other sweets left, but we took a break.
Now’s the time.
“Riri-chan.”
“O-Oh.”
Riri-chan’s voice was a bit tense, perhaps sensing my seriousness.
I reached into my backpack again and handed her what I had grabbed.
“Happy birthday!”
“Thank… you…?”
A black case rested in Riri-chan’s hands.
That’s my present.
“S-Suzuna-san…?”
“Ah, open it.”
She seemed like she wanted to say something, but I stopped her.
I want her to see the present first.
“O-Okay…”
She opened the case.
Inside was a silver chain with a small ring pendant.
“A necklace…?”
“Y-Yeah.”
I saw Riri-chan wearing a necklace with her casual clothes, so I thought it would be okay.
“N-No way… Suzuna, this is… too much.”
“Eh?”
I felt like I had been hit on the head.
Riri-chan’s sudden flustered reaction made me panic.
Eh, is it no good…?
Is a necklace a bad present…?
Ah, or does she not like the design?
I-I’m sorry, I have no taste…
“…I shouldn’t have chosen something like this…”
I got ahead of myself.
I’ll go back to the drawing board.
Or rather, please erase this from your memory.
“That’s not it, it’s just… it’s too much.”
“Ah, okay, I know. I’m not good enough for you, Riri-chan. I got ahead of myself…”
“That’s not what I mean! You gave me a stuffed animal, so I feel bad receiving something this… serious…”
“…Hmm?”
Apparently, she meant that our presents weren’t… equivalent.
“That’s not true.”
“The price is completely different.”
“It’s silver.”
It wasn’t that expensive.
“Even so…”
It’s rude to talk about prices, so Riri-chan didn’t press further.
But I also didn’t want to give her something cheap or tacky.
So I chose a brand I’ve heard of, even with my limited knowledge, so it should be a decent necklace.
“Do you… like it…?”
“Of course I do, since you chose it for me, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan looked at me with a slightly reproachful look.
A mixture of happiness and confusion… maybe?
“I’m glad. Then try it on.”
I moved behind Riri-chan.
“Eh, Suzuna…”
I took the necklace from her and clumsily fastened it around her neck.
It shimmered against her skin.
It suits her, and I think it’s cute.
I chose a small one, so it’s not too flashy.
“I’d be happy if you wore it…”
“Of course I will!”
“Whoa!”
Riri-chan turned around and jumped at me again.
My upper body sank into the bed.
“Thank you, Suzuna. I’ll treasure it.”
“Yeah, I’m glad.”
Riri-chan genuinely seemed happy with my present.
That makes me happier than anything.
------------------ 
91 What I Want to Give
Riri-chan was still hugging me, not letting go.
If this were the past me, I would have been surprised by the contact, but I wouldn’t have felt anything more.
But now, the cultural festival lingered in my mind, and my thoughts naturally drifted towards it.
“Suzuna.”
Riri-chan gazed into my eyes.
The atmosphere shifted.
I closed my eyes in response.
After a brief pause, our lips met.
We were alone, in a space where no one else existed.
Unhindered, my senses heightened.
Our lips met again and again, our tongues entwining.
“Nn…”
I’m not used to this, and I don’t really understand, but I responded to her movements.
It felt like we were melting together, becoming one.
The slippery, intertwining sensation was arousing, but not unpleasant.
Sensing each other’s unspoken cues, our lips parted.
“I don’t think I can hold back.”
“…Um…”
What am I supposed to say at a time like this?
Riri-chan didn’t give me even a moment to think.
She pressed her lips against mine again, more fiercely than before.
“Nn…”
Her hand caressed my chest over my T-shirt.
Her touch was gentle, but it was my first time, and I was flustered.
I didn’t know whether to focus on her lips or her hand on my chest.
“We’re… in that kind of relationship, right?”
Riri-chan’s heated gaze locked onto mine.
“…Are we going to… do it?”
“Do you not want to?”
“…”
“It’s my birthday, so you can listen to what I say, right?”
Being looked at like that, being told that… I couldn’t refuse.
“…Do what you want.”
I repeated the words I said to her once before, somewhere.
I looked away, embarrassed.
“You want to too, don’t you, Suzuna?”
But Riri-chan wouldn’t be satisfied with just that today.
She was seeking a clear answer.
But I can’t be as straightforward as her.
“…It’s not like I… don’t want to, but…”
“Then do you want to?”
She’s asking strange things again.
How much more does she want to pry out of me?
“…”
“I don’t know if you don’t say anything. I don’t want to do anything you don’t like, and I don’t want to force you.”
She’s not letting me escape.
Just like when we first met, Riri-chan is chasing after the fleeing me.
“…I don’t really know if I want to…”
Honestly, I think I’m more scared than anything.
I don’t know what will happen to me if we continue from where we left off last time.
Everything is so uncertain.
But there’s also something I’m sure of.
“But if you want me to, Riri-chan, I’ll… respond.”
If Riri-chan needs me, I want to fulfill her needs, even if it’s just a little.
Our relationship has been unequal, with me only receiving, so I want to give something back if I can.
If it’s for her, even something scary shouldn’t matter.
“…Suzuna.”
Riri-chan called my name again and kissed me.
Her hand slipped under the hem of my T-shirt.
It was ticklish at first, but it quickly turned into nervousness.
Because her hand was moving towards my chest.
“You’re warm.”
She said something so… casual while we were doing something so embarrassing.
Honestly, I couldn’t focus on that.
Her hand cupped my breast, making my breath hitch.
“Suzuna, relax a little.”
“Eh…”
I was pushed down onto the bed.
Riri-chan straddled me, and she seemed larger than usual.
Her gaze swept over my body.
“You’re staring too much.”
“It’s fine.”
“There’s nothing to look at.”
“Right now, you’re the only thing I want to look at, Suzuna.”
…I really don’t know how to respond to that.
“But looking isn’t enough.”
She lifted my T-shirt, exposing my bra.
This is beyond embarrassing.
“It’s in the way, so I’ll take it off.”
She unclasped my bra, and I lost the thin layer of fabric covering my chest.
Most of my upper body was bare, and I couldn’t take it.
“No!”
I twisted my body and crossed my arms over my chest.
“Suzuna, what are you doing?”
“This is a natural reaction! You should understand!”
“But we can’t start if you don’t move your hands.”
“I-I need to… mentally prepare myself!”
My heart will explode if she keeps undressing me so casually.
“Then I’ll wait until you’re ready.”
“Ah, eh…?”
Just when I thought she had accepted it surprisingly easily, Riri-chan disappeared from my view.
She had moved down to my feet and was undoing the button of my jeans.
“R-Riri-chan…”
If I move my arms, my chest will be exposed, but if I keep covering my chest, she’ll take off my jeans.
What should I do?!
“You’re not going to say no, are you?”
“…Ugh.”
But Riri-chan’s voice was serious, and my words, saying I would respond to her, weren’t a lie.
But the nervousness and embarrassment of my first time were overwhelming my resolve.
Riri-chan took my silence as consent and continued to undress me.
My T-shirt was almost completely rolled up, and I was only in my underwear.
There’s no way I can remain composed being looked at like this.
“D-Don’t look…”
“Why?”
She’s being mean.
She’s asking such a simple, abstract question just to make me say something embarrassing.
“I’m practically naked.”
“You’re beautiful.”
That’s not fair.
Undressing me, looking at me, and calling me beautiful…
She’s enjoying this.
“Come on, move your hands.”
She pushed my arms away, and her tongue traced a path across my chest.
My senses heightened even further.
The longer it continued, the harder it became to breathe.
“You don’t have to hold back your voice.”
“…I-It’s… normal…”
I can’t be any more embarrassed than this.
If she hears my voice after seeing me like this, I’ll probably die of mortification.
I gripped the bedsheet tightly, trying to endure it.
“That’s fine.”
Saying that, Riri-chan’s hand slid down my stomach.
Her fingertips moved past my lower abdomen, touching me… there.
“…You’re wet.”
Riri-chan’s fingers moved up and down, teasing my sensitive spot.
My head spun, and my back arched.
I felt like I was drowning in a wave of sensation.
“Are you feeling it?”
“…Y-You can… s-see… can’t you…?”
I was gasping for breath, losing the ability to speak properly.
“Does it feel good?”
“…I don’t know.”
“I don’t know if you don’t tell me.”
That’s a lie.
There’s no way she doesn’t know, seeing my reaction.
“…Don’t… make me talk…”
I’m afraid that if I speak, a different kind of voice might escape my lips.
A side of me I don’t even know might be unleashed.
“I want to touch you more, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s fingers slipped past my underwear, entering me.
This was completely different from before.
I was already a mess from her just touching me, but having her inside me was… overwhelming.
“Ah…”
I couldn’t endure it any longer and grabbed Riri-chan’s shoulders.
Tightly, with all my might.
I don’t think I can withstand this wave otherwise.
But Riri-chan continued, relentlessly teasing my Secret Place.
“You look so cute when you’re feeling it, Suzuna.”
A sweet whisper.
That was the limit.
I was holding onto Riri-chan tightly, but the overwhelming sensation made my body convulse.
My mind went blank, and I couldn’t see anything.
I lost myself in the surging pleasure.
How long did it last?
I don’t even know, my consciousness shattered and melted away.
“…Ah…”
My scattered senses returned, and the tension finally drained from my body.
My muscles relaxed completely.
I couldn’t think anymore.
“Suzuna.”
“…What?”
Riri-chan’s voice was the only thing that reached me through my hazy consciousness.
I don’t know how to speak, what expression to make at a time like this.
“You moaned at the end.”
“…”
I grabbed a nearby cushion and threw it at Riri-chan with all my might.
92 What Remains
“Suzuna.”
Riri-chan called my name.
“…”
“Hey, Suzuna.”
“…”
I ignored her.
Or rather, I don’t know how to face her.
I don’t know what to do after… that, so I wish someone would tell me the right answer.
But if the right answer is to casually chat with Riri-chan, I definitely can’t do that, so I’m demanding a different solution.
“Are you angry?”
I’m not angry.
She didn’t do anything to make me angry.
I’m just… paralyzed by embarrassment.
I quickly put my clothes on.
I can’t stand being the only one naked.
“…Well, then it’s fine. Um…”
As I was getting dressed, facing away from her, I heard Riri-chan move.
Is she giving up on me and doing something else…?
Somehow, that also bothered me, so I glanced at her.
“…?!”
Riri-chan was staring intently at her right hand.
Her fingers… were wet from touching me… from touching my… center…
Anyway, I don’t understand why she’s staring at them like that.
“Okay.”
She took a deep breath, as if making up her mind.
Then she brought her fingers to her mouth, as if to… lick them…?!
“Are you stupid?!”
“Whoa!”
I grabbed her arm just in time and stopped her.
“What are you doing?!”
“Eh…? Ah, well, ehehe…”
She looked embarrassed and flustered.
No, I don’t think that’s it.
I don’t really understand these kinds of situations, but I don’t think that’s a normal reaction.
“You were going to lick them, weren’t you?”
“…Ufufu.”
Riri-chan just giggled, not denying it.
That’s not sane.
“Why would you do that?!”
“…It seemed like a waste…”
A waste of what?
“Just wipe it off.”
I handed Riri-chan a tissue.
“Ehhh…”
“It’s not ‘ehhh.’”
I made her wipe her fingers.
“And go wash your hands.”
“Why?”
I can’t see it, and it might have dried, but it’s still… a fluid, so I feel like it’s… soaked in, or there’s some residue…
It’s a sensory thing.
“It… remains, you know?”
“Is it bad if it remains?”
“It’s dirty.”
“It’s not dirty.”
What’s wrong with her?
“Just do it!”
“Eh, Suzuna…”
I took Riri-chan’s hand and led her to the sink.
I turned on the faucet and made her use hand soap.
“Wash them properly.”
“…You don’t have to go this far. You’re not a germ, Suzuna.”
“It’s practically the same thing.”
It’s definitely not hygienic.
Riri-chan reluctantly washed her hands.
Finally, I started to calm down.
“But, you know, I’d be a little shocked if it were the other way around.”
“The other way around?”
“Yeah, you know… if it were… on you, Suzuna…”
At first, I didn’t understand what she was trying to say with her mumbling, but I quickly caught on.
“Don’t be ridiculous!”
Seriously, what is she talking about?
“I’d be worried about being treated like a germ.”
Riri-chan finished washing her hands and dried them with a towel.
I wouldn’t think it was dirty if it were the other way around.
I only overreacted because it was on Riri-chan.
Riri-chan, unaware of that, was worried, but I didn’t feel like explaining.
I think my head would explode if I continued this strange conversation.
“Come on, let’s go back.”
Instead of a verbal response, I took Riri-chan’s hand and led her back to the room.
“…Suzuna, how was it?”
But Riri-chan was going to continue this strange conversation.
“How was what?”
“Earlier. Was it… good?”
“…Why do you want to know that?”
“Because I’d be happy if it was. It was my first time too, so I’m not confident, and I’d hate it if I hurt you.”
I don’t really want to talk about what happened earlier in detail.
I want to erase it from my memory because it’s embarrassing.
She’s asking because she’s worried about my appearance and my reaction, but if we only consider what she did…
“…You saw me… at the end.”
“Yeah, I saw.”
She answered instantly.
That made my blood rush, and my face heated up.
“It’s the same. It didn’t hurt, and I didn’t hate it.”
“…I see. That’s good.”
Riri-chan’s voice was gentle and satisfied.
“It’s a good birthday.”
I’m happy to hear her say that, but it also feels strange.
It’s her birthday, but I’m the one who… received.
It feels like it should be the other way around.
So I do want to… do that for her someday.
But I don’t know when, how, or what to do.
I don’t think I can be as smooth as Riri-chan.
But not doing it is also not an option.
It’s strange for me to be the only one receiving.
Thinking about it made me nervous, embarrassed, and uneasy.
“Suzuna.”
“Eh, what?”
Riri-chan hugged me from behind.
“…You’re heavy.”
“Who are you calling fat?”
“I didn’t say that.”
She even nuzzled my cheek, clinging to me.
“Let’s celebrate together every year from now on.”
She asked, as if seeking confirmation.
“…Of course.”
“You’re not allowed to leave me.”
How am I supposed to leave her now?
Riri-chan might be able to handle it, but I definitely can’t.
I think I’d be heartbroken and my mental state would crumble.
Just imagining it makes my chest ache.
“I won’t leave you.”
“Ehehe…”
Riri-chan kissed my cheek lightly.
I feel like today’s kisses alone have surpassed the total number of kisses we’ve shared until now.
------------------ 
93 A Careless Person
It’s another school day.
I’m meeting up with Riri-chan to walk to school, but I can’t stop fidgeting, thinking about yesterday.
After a night of reflection, I feel like I did something incredibly reckless.
It’s like… she saw a side of me I never show anyone, and yet, we’re back to our normal routine.
It feels strange to go about my daily life with someone who knows my… other side…
“Good morning, Suzuuu-na!”
Yeah.
It seems like I’m the only one feeling sentimental.
She’s as cheerful as ever, maybe even more so than usual.
Her skin looks… radiant.
“G-Good morning… Riri-chan. You seem more energetic than usual today.”
“Fufufu… can you tell?”
I can tell without her saying anything.
Her glamorous aura is even more pronounced than usual.
“Look at this.”
Riri-chan bent down and showed me her chest.
I braced myself, wondering what she was showing me so early in the morning, and then I noticed something sparkling around her neck.
“A necklace…?”
“Yeah, the birthday present you gave me, Suzuna. I’m wearing it.”
“Is that why you’re so cheerful?”
“Of course. This way, I feel like you’re always watching over me, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan smiled brightly.
S-So that’s why…
Well, I’m happy. Really happy.
But I thought it was because of… what we did yesterday…
I started to feel embarrassed, wondering if I’m the pervert.
“Hmm? Were you thinking of something else?”
As always, Riri-chan didn’t miss my subtle change in expression.
“I wasn’t.”
“You had a ‘was it the present?’ look on your face.”
“I didn’t.”
She’s spot on.
Riri-chan’s intuition at times like these is so sharp that it sends chills down my spine.
“I also liked your cute reaction yesterday, Suzuna.”
She knows, and she’s moving closer.
As Riri-chan leaned forward to look at my face, her neckline dipped, revealing her chest along with the necklace.
It was quite a sight, and I felt uncomfortable.
“Riri-chan, I’ve been meaning to ask…”
If this continues, she’ll keep teasing me until we get to school.
I decided to interrupt her and make her listen to me.
“Hmm, I’ll listen, but if you’re changing the subject because you’re embarrassed, I’ll ignore you.”
What’s that supposed to mean?
But it’s scary how she can see right through me.
“Aren’t the buttons of your blouse… undone a bit too much?”
“…What do you mean?”
“It’s fine that you want to show off the necklace, but even so, it’s too open. I can almost see your chest.”
If she bends down, her underwear will definitely be visible.
“Eh, but I’m usually careful. And no one really cares.”
Riri-chan replied casually.
But I didn’t like her reaction.
“No, it’s visible.”
“I’m only careless around you, Suzuna. I’m careful at school, especially around boys, so it’s fine.”
She replied nonchalantly, as if I’m worrying too much.
She’s not listening to me at all.
I don’t like that.
Being brushed off like this only made me angrier.
“No, it’s not fine. Even without doing anything, your blouse is too open, you’re showing too much skin.”
“But it’s tight if I button it up.”
“Then button up just one more. You can still see the necklace.”
“No, it’ll slightly cover it. And it won’t… stand out.”
She’s being stubborn.
She usually listens to me.
But when it comes to clothes, she suddenly becomes uncooperative.
I don’t want to nag her about her fashion choices, but…
“It’s not about standing out or not. I’m saying it’s not good that your chest is visible.”
“Why are you saying this now? You’ve never said that before, Suzuna.”
…Hmm.
It’s true that I haven’t said that before.
I thought she was… open, but I never thought about making her button up.
But if you ask me why I want her to now, I have an answer.
“It’s different now. You’re mine, Riri-chan, so don’t dress so carelessly.”
That’s right.
Since Riri-chan is dating me, she shouldn’t show any vulnerability to anyone else.
It’s not good to have her blouse unbuttoned or to expose her legs with a short skirt.
It’s wrong for anyone else to see Riri-chan’s skin.
“O-Oh…”
Riri-chan looked like she had been struck by lightning.
Did my message get through, even a little?
“And that skirt is also no good. Why are you showing so much leg?”
“Well, it’s not like I’m… showing them… it’s… fashion.”
“That’s why I’m saying it’s not good! People will look!”
“Hmm… but it… boosts my mood.”
She’s still saying that after all this?
“That’s why boys stare at you! You’re too careless, Riri-chan, you have no sense of danger!”
“Well… I don’t know about that…”
“…Seriously…”
I’m getting more and more irritated.
Riri-chan’s lack of awareness, the way she’s not listening to me…
She simply doesn’t understand how I feel.
“You’re so stubborn, Riri-chan.”
I was getting seriously angry.
I undid two buttons of my own blouse.
I also rolled up my skirt.
It was clumsy and awkward since I’ve never done this before, but…
Anyway, my skirt was now about as short as Riri-chan’s.
“S-Suzuna…?!”
“How would you feel if I went to school like this, Riri-chan?”
“…N-No! That’s indecent!”
You’re one to talk!
Well, that’s what I wanted her to say.
“Right? Now you understand how I feel. So stop it, Riri-chan.”
“W-Well… I understand what you mean, but… it’s also about… image.”
“…Image?”
“I’m already… that kind of person, so it doesn’t feel out of place, and I don’t think many people care. But you’re different, Suzuna. If a serious girl like you suddenly dresses like this, the gap makes it… sexy.”
“…Is that how it works?”
“Look for yourself.”
We happened to pass by a building with reflective windows, and I could see my reflection.
It definitely looked strange.
“So, let’s fix this.”
“Ah, okay…”
Riri-chan buttoned my blouse and unrolled my skirt.
“There, there, now you’re back to your usual self, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan seemed more relieved than I was.
“So, Riri-chan, will you… dress normally?”
“Hmm… I’ll think about it.”
That’s what someone who’s not going to do it would say.
But I said what I wanted to say, so I feel a little better.
“But I’m happy that you were worried about me, Suzuna.”
“Of course I was. You’re beautiful and cute, Riri-chan, so be more aware of that.”
“Hmm… ahaha… I don’t know how to react to that.”
Riri-chan scratched her cheek, looking truly troubled.
Her face also seemed slightly red.
I’m starting to feel embarrassed, like I said too much.
“Suzuna, you can dress like that when we have a date at home.”
“Why?”
“Eh…? Ehehe.”
Her laugh suddenly sounded suggestive.
“…I won’t.”
She really doesn’t understand.
94 Secrets
“—Fufu.”
As we walked down the hallway after arriving at school, Riri-chan, next to me, was humming cheerfully.
I was feeling down about the upcoming classes, so I wondered what she found so amusing.
“You seem to be in a good mood.”
“Yeah, I am. Thanks to this.”
Riri-chan touched the necklace at her neckline, showing it off.
I’m happy that she likes it, but I just saw it, so is there a need to show it off again?
“Put it away.”
“Cold.”
“Don’t emphasize your chest like that.”
“Not this again.”
Riri-chan’s expression turned sullen.
It seems like even she doesn’t like being told what to do with her appearance.
“It’s not good to show it off like that…”
“Hinase-san, what is that?”
Speak of the devil.
Kanaori Reika stood before us, her eyes narrowed.
“Ugh… Kanaori, so early in the morning…”
“I don’t recall giving you any reason to make that face. More importantly, what is that ornament around your neck?”
Riri-chan instinctively twisted her body to hide her neckline.
Too late, I think.
“I-It’s nothing.”
“Wearing metal accessories is prohibited at school.”
Kanaori-san approached Riri-chan with a stern expression and reached for her neck.
“Hey, don’t touch me!”
Riri-chan brushed her hand away.
“I’m confiscating it. Hand it over.”
Riri-chan continued to hide her neckline, covering it with her own hand.
She wouldn’t give in.
“Why should I give it to you?”
“I’ll hand it over to your homeroom teacher.”
“Then I’ll give it to them myself. You can leave.”
“Do you think I’d believe that?”
Kanaori-san’s gaze sharpened, and her argument was valid.
I don’t think Riri-chan has any room for rebuttal…
“…Fine, fine, I understand. I’ll give it to you.”
Riri-chan let go of the hand she was using to cover her neck, and something shiny flew through the air.
“H-How dare you throw it! That’s indecent!”
Kanaori-san hurriedly caught it.
There was a clinking sound.
“There. I’m leaving now.”
Riri-chan brushed past Kanaori-san.
“…W-Wait, Riri-chan.”
Kanaori-san didn’t stop her, so it must have been the necklace she threw.
…But honestly, I’m feeling conflicted.
“Honestly, that girl… when will she ever follow the rules?”
I bowed my head to Kanaori-san, who was clicking her tongue, and then I chased after Riri-chan.
◇◇◇
“Riri-chan.”
I caught up to Riri-chan, who was walking briskly.
It’s hard to keep up with her when she’s serious about walking fast.
“Ah, Suzuna. She’s not coming, is she?”
Riri-chan looked around nervously.
She seems to be very wary of Kanaori-san.
“She’s not. More importantly, what are we going to do about that?”
It’s the worst that my present, of all things, was confiscated.
“Ah, it’s fine. I’ll get it back eventually.”
It’s true that it won’t be disposed of even if it’s confiscated.
She’ll probably get it back eventually.
But that’s not the issue.
“But you didn’t have to treat it like that, did you?”
She gave up too easily.
She just threw it.
And she’s saying it’s fine because she’ll get it back.
I thought she’d treasure it, so I’m shocked by how carelessly she treated it.
I’m not saying she has to treat it like a family heirloom, but I don’t want her to be so careless with it either.
“Well, it’s mine after all.”
“…”
That ticked me off.
It’s true that it’s hers since it was a present.
But that’s not what presents are about, is it?
She can think that, but I don’t want her to say it or act like it.
My head started to boil.
“I see.”
I brushed past Riri-chan, annoyed.
I don’t want to think about this anymore, or I might say something I’ll regret.
I’ll go back to my seat in the classroom and calm down.
“Suzuna? What’s wrong all of a sudden?”
Riri-chan followed me.
What is she thinking, following me like this?
“It’s nothing.”
“You’re suddenly angry.”
Of course, I am. Anyone would be.
“I just realized you’re insensitive, Riri-chan, so I don’t want to talk to you anymore.”
I was trying to keep quiet, but my mouth moved when Riri-chan asked.
I blurted out my feelings.
“Why?”
That’s what makes you insensitive.
I thought you were more considerate.
“Wait a minute.”
She grabbed my hand from behind.
Riri-chan is faster and stronger than me, so it’s difficult for me to escape if she seriously chases after me.
But that’s not the issue here.
“Suzuna, are you even listening to me?”
What a ridiculous thing to say after I’ve already made my judgment after listening to her.
“I get it. You’re the type of person who gives up on my presents, throws them away, and forgets about them, aren’t you, Riri-chan?”
“No, that’s not what I—”
“You were wearing it, saying, ‘This way, I feel like you’re always watching over me, Suzuna,’ and the next moment, you just tossed it aside.”
I can’t trust someone like that’s words.
“You’ll just throw me away too when it’s convenient, won’t you? Fine, then just leave me alone.”
I should just throw her away like the necklace.
She thinks I’ll come back eventually, right?
I’ll show her that it’s not that simple.
“Seriously, you’re so quick to jump to conclusions, Suzuna.”
She suddenly pulled my wrist and pressed my face against her chest.
“Hey, stop it!”
“There, there, calm down, Suzuna.”
“Don’t treat me like a horse!”
“You’re like an animal when you’re excited, Suzuna.”
What’s that supposed to mean?
I don’t want to be treated like that by such an insensitive person.
“Look at this.”
She loosened her grip on my head, and my eyes fell on her neckline.
My necklace was sparkling there.
“…Huh?”
“I’ve been hiding it this whole time.”
It’s true that she was covering her neck and twisting her body so Kanaori-san wouldn’t see it.
“…Then what did you give Kanaori-san?”
“Something I had with me. I had it in my bag, just in case, and I threw it at her in the heat of the moment.”
…What’s that supposed to mean?
“So you gave Kanaori-san a different necklace?”
“Yeah, that’s why I wanted to leave quickly before she noticed. This kind of thing happens often, so I’m prepared. I didn’t think she’d actually confiscate it, though.”
So she gave up on it easily, threw it, and didn’t care because it was her own necklace.
“…”
“See? Don’t worry. I’ll treasure the one you gave me, Suzuna.”
She patted my head.
“Don’t treat me like a child!”
“But you are one. You get angry easily and stop listening.”
She’s grinning.
She’s definitely looking down on me.
“Just take it off or hide it. What if she confiscates it again?”
“Ah… yeah, okay.”
Riri-chan reluctantly buttoned up one more button.
You could still see it if you looked closely, but it wasn’t obvious at first glance.
“Is this okay?”
“Ah, yeah…”
She was so against it earlier.
It’s strange that she’s suddenly listening to me.
“…Really?”
“You get angry easily when it comes to me, Suzuna. But you’re cute, so I’ll forgive you.”
And she patted my head again.
“Stop treating me like a child!”
I brushed her hand away.
“That’s what makes you a child. Well, I don’t mind since it’s a side of you you only show me.”
…Hmm.
It’s annoying to be treated like a child, but…
I’ll let it slide since my present made her cover up her exposed chest.
------------------ 
95 Past and Present Relationships
After school.
“The final exams are coming up soon.”
Shindo-kun spoke to me as I was getting ready to go home.
“That’s true.”
Just when I thought the flurry of events from the sports festival to the cultural festival was over, now it’s exam season.
I wish this hectic schedule would stop.
“Are you studying?”
“No, not at all.”
“Me neither.”
“Isn’t that bad?”
“You too.”
Casual, everyday conversation.
Even so, I’m the only one Shindo-kun talks to among the heroines at school.
“Hey, teach me again like before.”
How long ago is he referring to?
Is he talking about the study session we had in the student council room with all the heroines?
Or is he talking about older memories with Amatsuki Suzuna, his childhood friend?
…Either way.
“Sorry, I think that will be difficult.”
“Do you have something to do?”
“I do.”
I feel like I will have something to do, and even if I don’t, I shouldn’t study with Shindo-kun.
“…With Hinase-san…?”
“Maybe.”
I nodded, since there’s no reason to deny it.
“You’ve really become close with Hinase lately.”
“…Yeah.”
I can’t tell him it’s because we’re dating.
“I see, I see, then it can’t be helped.”
Shindo-kun paused slightly.
“You’ve changed, Suzuna.”
“…Have I?”
From Shindo-kun’s perspective, his childhood friend, whom he’s known for so long, has become distant.
So he’s probably not happy about it.
“Yeah, you seem like a different person.”
…Well, I am a different person.
And I can’t get closer to Shindo-kun.
Even after the cultural festival, there’s been no progress in his relationships with the heroines.
At this rate, I might end up with the bad ending, the one where I get closer to him.
“Suzuna, let’s go home!”
Riri-chan’s voice called out to me.
“Ah, okay, I’m coming.”
During the cultural festival, which was supposed to be a branching point, I was only thinking about Riri-chan.
The individual routes branch off at the start of the new semester in September, after summer break.
In other words, a little over a month from now.
I have to think about what will happen as time passes.
“See you later, Shindo-kun.”
“Yeah, see ya.”
◇◇◇
“What were you talking about with Shindo?”
Riri-chan’s tone was slightly sharp.
She might be bothered by something.
“It was nothing, we were just talking about how the final exams are coming up soon.”
“…Anything else?”
I’ve told Riri-chan many times that Shindo-kun is nothing to me.
And she said she understood.
But today is different, it seems.
“He just asked me to help him study.”
“…Don’t tell me…”
“I refused. That’s definitely not happening.”
I’m talking about the ending in this world.
I know it’s not good, for Riri-chan’s sake and mine.
“…Okay, if you say so.”
But Riri-chan’s mood didn’t improve.
She remained sullen as we went outside.
I don’t want to go home in this awkward atmosphere.
“What’s wrong, Riri-chan? You’ve been acting strange.”
“…I’m just… not happy.”
“Not happy?”
“Shindo’s a childhood friend you’ve known for a long time, so you talk to him casually, right?”
“Well…”
That’s what childhood friends do.
“I know you don’t have feelings for Shindo anymore, Suzuna. But you’re still talking to him because of your past relationship, right?”
“That might be true.”
“I only know the Suzuna from our second year. I can’t compete with that kind of long-term relationship.”
“Ah, well…”
That might be true, but…
“But it’s the same for both of us, isn’t it? You have a childhood friend too, Riri-chan.”
“I do, but I don’t have a male childhood friend who talks to me so casually.”
“Ah, I see…”
That’s right, Riri-chan said she’s not good with boys.
Maybe she doesn’t understand a relationship like Amatsuki Suzuna and Shindo Minato.
“So—”
“Eh, ah!”
Was it intentional, or not?
I was suddenly pushed against the wall of a quiet street.
“H-Hey, Riri-chan…”
“Just be quiet.”
She kissed me.
After a few deep kisses, our lips finally parted.
Today’s kiss was more forceful than before, almost… painful.
“I’m the only one who can kiss you like this, Suzuna, the only one who can see this side of you.”
What does she want, saying such embarrassing things with a straight face?
This conversation has strayed far from the topic of Shindo-kun.
“…That’s true.”
“But your memories, your past relationships, they don’t belong to me. And that frustrates me.”
“Frustrates you…?”
“It frustrates me that your past doesn’t belong to me. And that the relationship you had then is still continuing in a different form.”
“That’s…”
“I know, I know, it’s pointless to think about it. And I’m not saying it’s your fault, Suzuna. But I can’t help but think…”
Riri-chan looked away as she spoke.
“Why wasn’t I your first love?”
“…Ah.”
So that’s what it was.
Riri-chan is my first love, but for Amatsuki Suzuna, it was Shindo Minato.
That relationship always follows us, and that’s what frustrates Riri-chan.
But that’s not true.
That’s Amatsuki Suzuna’s story, not mine, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
So we’re actually the same.
“Th-That’s not true, Riri-chan… it’s really not like that…”
“It’s okay, Suzuna. I know I’m being stupid.”
“No, really, I never liked Shindo-kun from the beginn—”
How do I explain this?
How do I make her understand that it’s Amatsuki Suzuna’s story, not Yukitsuki Mashiro’s?
Would she believe me if I said I’m a different person, reincarnated?
Would she understand everything if I told her that?
“Sorry, I was being mean. It’s not your fault, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan gently stroked my head.
Her touch and her voice were truly gentle, and yet, it was painful.
The existence of Amatsuki Suzuna continues to haunt me, no matter how much I struggle.
That existence, which is me and yet not me, is distorting my relationship with Riri-chan.
If I could just tell her the truth, if she could just believe me…
This small dissonance would disappear, and I think we could become even closer.
“I know that you’re only mine now, Suzuna. I should be satisfied with that. I’m so childish.”
…I’ve only ever been yours, Riri-chan.
And yet, maybe the reason I don’t have the courage to tell her the truth is because I’m relying on the existence of Amatsuki Suzuna.
96 Maybe I’m Being Tamed: Hinase Riri’s Side
Suzuna is generally quiet and reserved.
She dislikes trouble and avoids standing out.
But there are two things that can suddenly trigger a dramatic change in her behavior.
One is anything related to me.
She suddenly started practicing volleyball alone, bit me when she got angry, and even went shopping at an unfamiliar store for my birthday present.
She noticed the small cut on my finger that no one else did, and she even confessed her feelings to me.
None of these are things the usual Suzuna would do; it’s a side of her she only shows me.
That makes me feel special, and I’m happy about it.
But I’m not the only trigger for her sudden bursts of activity.
The other is anything related to Shindo Minato.
Suzuna also acts strangely towards Shindo.
She tried to teach his younger sister, Shindo Kokona, how to cook, organized a study session, and talked to him during the sports festival when I wasn’t around.
More than anything, her attitude towards him is different.
Suzuna, who usually shows no interest in anyone, is clearly interested in him.
She told me it wasn’t romantic love, but she hasn’t revealed what it is.
Suzuna is hiding something about Shindo.
That much is clear.
She just avoids the topic whenever I ask, refusing to answer directly.
I didn’t mind at first.
But now that we’re dating, I can’t overlook these subtle changes.
I can’t stand the thought of her being interested in someone else besides me.
I’m being childish.
I know that.
But I can’t help it.
I just want Suzuna all to myself.
◇◇◇
“Hey, Suzuna, help me study for the finals.”
I asked Suzuna, linking arms with her as we walked home.
Suzuna used to try to pull away immediately, but she’s become more accepting since we started dating.
That makes me very happy.
Suzuna’s arms are slender, her delicate frame seeming fragile.
“Okay, but… where are we studying? The cafe?”
“How about at home?”
Neither of us has parents at home, and our relationship has changed, so there’s no need to go to the cafe every time.
“…Ah, yeah, that’s fine.”
Suzuna looked away.
She has a habit of averting her gaze when she’s thinking about something.
“Suzuna, are you thinking of something… strange?”
“What do you mean, ‘strange’?”
Her tone suddenly became curt.
Her tone usually changes when I hit a nerve.
“I know you well enough to tell, Suzuna.”
I teased her, deliberately being vague.
“You’re annoying, Riri-chan.”
“Should I do it again?”
“I’m going home alone.”
“Ah, just kidding.”
Suzuna uses strong words like “going home alone,” but she doesn’t actually let go of my arm.
She probably doesn’t want to leave me, I think.
I find that change cute.
◇◇◇
We studied at Suzuna’s house.
I’ve become used to this house, and being with Suzuna has become quite natural.
Being together feels normal, and being apart feels strange.
That’s the kind of relationship I wanted.
And I’m wearing the necklace Suzuna gave me.
Wanting to touch it, to feel a stronger connection to her, I unbuttoned my blouse.
It felt cool against my skin.
“…Riri-chan.”
“Hmm? What?”
Suzuna, sitting across from me at the low table, was giving me a sharp look.
But she wasn’t making eye contact.
“Why did you unbutton your blouse?”
Ah, she was looking at my chest.
“It’s stuffy, and I wanted to touch my necklace.”
“…Hmm.”
“Ah, did that make your heart race?”
Suzuna’s gaze sharpened even further.
“Of course not.”
“It’s okay if it did.”
And since she’s reacting so strongly to just one button undone, it’s not like she doesn’t feel anything.
But Suzuna avoids that kind of communication.
It’s like my birthday never happened.
“It’s fine at home, but button it up when we’re outside.”
She said reprovingly.
“But if we’re not at school, it’s fine, isn’t it?”
“It’s okay to show the necklace, but not your chest.”
So she’s basically telling me to button up.
“I was thinking… you’re saying that because you’re looking at my chest, aren’t you, Suzuna? You call me a pervert, but you’re thinking about that kind of thing too?”
Since Suzuna always denies that kind of thing, she’ll probably deny this too.
Then she won’t be able to complain about my clothes anymore.
Because if she doesn’t care, there’s no reason for me not to do it.
“…Is it bad if I am?”
An unexpected answer.
I didn’t think she’d admit it so readily.
“Ah, hmm… so you think about that kind of thing too, Suzuna.”
Her answer was so unexpected that I didn’t know how to react.
“Of course I do. But I don’t want you to… show that side of you to anyone else. So don’t.”
“…”
“Well?”
“Well, I guess… just the blouse is fine.”
I have to button it up at school anyway.
“And lengthen your skirt.”
“No way, this is fine.”
I understand the blouse, but…
The skirt is an overreaction.
It’s just fashion.
“…You’re not listening, are you?”
Suzuna suddenly stood up.
She sat down next to me.
And stared intently at my legs.
“Suzuna?”
“…Then I’ll do this.”
Suzuna lowered her head and started biting my leg.
“Ouch…”
A sharp pain shot through my left thigh.
I forgot since it’s been a while.
Suzuna bites me when her emotions are in turmoil.
I was about to stop her because it hurt when she looked up.
“How about… here?”
The bite mark was close to my knee.
With the length of my skirt, it would be visible.
“This… can be seen.”
She’s always bitten places that could be hidden.
“Then hide it. Lengthen your skirt.”
“…You’d go this far…?”
I think Suzuna is losing it.
Biting my leg and leaving a mark in a visible place just to make me lengthen my skirt…
That’s not normal behavior.
“I will.”
Suzuna touched my necklace.
“This necklace binds your neck, and I can bind your legs by biting them. So I will.”
“That’s… twisted.”
Suzuna pouted, seemingly aware of it.
“I know. But I want to do this.”
“…I like that side of you, but sometimes, I want a normal expression of affection.”
I know it’s wishful thinking.
But I don’t think it would hurt to receive Suzuna’s straightforward love sometimes.
“Normal…”
“Yeah, normal.”
I know it’s impossible for the twisted Suzuna-chan.
But it would be nice if she’d say something straightforward like “cute” or “I like you” sometimes.
Suzuna always has to have some kind of… twist.
“…”
Suzuna suddenly knelt down and straddled me.
“Riri-chan.”
“What? Are you going to bite my face next?— Hey!”
She pulled me closer.
Thump, thump, thump The sound of my heartbeat.
And Suzuna’s gentle scent filled my nostrils.
She hugged me, and I buried my face in her chest.
“…Like this?”
Her voice trailed off, lacking confidence.
“Ah… yeah.”
Apparently, I’m the type who melts at the slightest bit of affection from Suzuna.
I’m surprised by how easily swayed I am.
------------------ 
97 A False Existence
“…So? How is it?”
Riri-chan’s face was buried in my chest.
Well, my chest isn’t as large as Riri-chan’s, so “buried” might not be the right word.
Resting on my chest, maybe.
Anyway, I did this because Riri-chan wanted a normal expression of affection.
I want some kind of reaction.
“…Suu… haa…”
She was… inhaling.
“What are you doing?”
“Smelling you.”
“…”
“Ah! Sorry, sorry. Don’t move.”
She clung to me when I tried to pull away because she was saying strange things.
She’s the one who should act more normal.
“Hey, Suzuna.”
Riri-chan’s voice was muffled against my blouse.
“What?”
“We’re alone right now.”
“…I know.”
“We’re lovers, right?”
“We are.”
“Isn’t this… what we’re supposed to do at times like these?”
“…”
I kind of understand what she’s trying to say.
I do, but…
“We’re supposed to be studying.”
“After I invited you over like this?”
I could feel Riri-chan’s breath against my chest.
It was warm and moist, and I sensed her emotions in it.
“I didn’t mean it like that.”
“Then when will you mean it like that?”
It’s not like I don’t have those feelings.
But I’ve decided that I’ll be the one to initiate it next time.
If I let Riri-chan take the lead, I feel like I’ll just keep relying on her and taking advantage of our relationship.
So I’ve decided that I’ll do it when I have the courage.
“Not today.”
“…You’re teasing me.”
Riri-chan grumbled and lifted her head.
“You can bite me whenever you want, Suzuna, but I’m being kept waiting.”
Riri-chan was rubbing her thigh.
Riri-chan, restricted by the necklace I gave her and the bite mark I left.
That’s good.
Riri-chan is free-spirited, so I need to restrict her.
Even if that free-spiritedness is what brought us closer.
She’s mine now, so she doesn’t need to be free.
“Sorry.”
“…Ah, well, I was kidding.”
Riri-chan seemed surprised that I apologized so readily.
I don’t feel bad about restricting Riri-chan’s freedom, but I do feel bad about suppressing her desire for me.
Because that’s her desire for me.
And those feelings make me happy.
I moved back to my usual spot across from Riri-chan and resumed studying.
“Suzuna.”
“…What?”
Just when I thought we were going to study, Riri-chan spoke again.
She apparently doesn’t intend to study yet.
“What’s my name?”
“…”
It seems like Riri-chan’s brain has been fried from studying too much.
I’m worried.
“Did you lose your memory?”
“I’m asking you seriously.”
“That’s not a serious question.”
“Just answer me.”
…I don’t understand, but I’ll answer if she insists.
“Riri-chan.”
“Buzz! Wrong.”
She stuck out her lower lip, emphasizing the “buzz.”
“It seems like you really did lose your memory. Should we go to the hospital?”
“That’s not true! Tell me my name properly!”
What is she even talking about?
“It’s Riri-chan, isn’t it? What else could it be?”
…Don’t tell me she’s going to say she’s also a reincarnator.
Both heroines being reincarnators is a common trope; it wouldn’t be surprising.
But I’m not hoping for that.
“My name isn’t ‘Riri-chan.’”
“…Don’t tell me you’re trying to say something stupid.”
“Your name is ‘Suzuna,’ not ‘Suzuna-chan.’”
…I’m relieved that Riri-chan isn’t a reincarnator.
But why is she emphasizing such a trivial thing?
“What’s the difference? They’re the same.”
“They’re not. Don’t you think the ‘-chan’ is unnecessary now?”
“…I wonder.”
“It is. Since we’re lovers, shouldn’t we call each other by our first names?”
“I’m used to it, so it’s fine the way it is.”
“It’s not fine. There’s a subtle distance. It’s strange that I call you by your first name, but you don’t do the same for me.”
“Then call me ‘Suzuna-chan.’”
That would be equal, and there wouldn’t be the dissonance she’s talking about.
“No. You know that’s not what I mean.”
I kind of understand, and I kind of don’t…
“But I’m used to ‘Riri-chan.’ It’s fine the way it is.”
“You’ll get used to calling me by my first name too.”
“…Okay, I’ll call you ‘Riri-chan.’”
It’s one thing at the beginning, but we’ve reached a comfortable distance.
I don’t think there’s a need to create awkwardness now.
“You’re so mean, Suzuna…”
Riri-chan slumped onto the desk, throwing her arms out.
“I know you’re shy, Suzuna.”
“I’m not.”
“But I want you to say it someday.”
“…Someday.”
I didn’t make a promise, but I also didn’t completely deny it.
Maybe I’ll call her by her first name someday, if I change my mind.
“So, you’ll be with me during summer break, right?”
Riri-chan’s face lit up.
Her emotions are so easy to read, her expressions changing instantly.
“…Aren’t you the busy one, Riri-chan?”
I can’t imagine Riri-chan’s friends leaving her alone.
Her schedule must be completely full.
“Don’t worry, I’ll cancel everything.”
“…”
Déjà vu.
I’m happy to spend time with her, but I don’t think she needs to cancel everything.
“So we’ll be together all of summer break.”
…All of it, huh?
I’m fine with that, but there’s also the Shindo-kun situation.
The individual routes will be determined after summer break, so I might need to check on his progress before then.
“Yeah, I think it’ll be fine.”
“…You think?”
Riri-chan is fixated on that word.
“Something might come up.”
“Ah, well… that’s true.”
She nodded, accepting that it couldn’t be helped.
I feel bad for giving such vague answers.
◇◇◇
Time passed slowly as we both struggled to concentrate.
“I should probably go home soon.”
Riri-chan initiated the end of our study session, and I walked her to the entrance.
It was completely dark outside, and the oppressive heat had subsided slightly.
“…Riri-chan, your skirt.”
Her leg, with the bite mark, was still exposed.
“Hmm? Ah, this… it’s fine.”
“Really? Are you going to wear it like that at school too?”
“Yeah. If anyone asks, ‘What happened to your leg?,’ I’ll say, ‘Suzuna bit me.’”
“…That’s…”
I didn’t expect her to be so bold.
I didn’t anticipate that kind of development.
“Fufu, just kidding. I’m only showing it off because it’s dark and no one can see. I’ll hide it at school.”
She just wanted to see me panic.
Riri-chan smirked.
“What’s that about?”
“Just… revenge for various things.”
Well, I’ve also been teasing her, so I can’t complain.
“Hey, Suzuna.”
The cool night air ruffled my hair.
Riri-chan gently brushed it aside and looked at me.
“What?”
“I like you, Suzuna.”
“…”
What is she saying all of a sudden?
“So, I’m on your side, Suzuna. Tell me anything.”
“Okay.”
“Don’t lie.”
“…Okay.”
I think she’s saying all this because she likes me.
But Riri-chan’s tone was so serious that I could only nod in response.
“Good. See you later, Suzuna.”
I waved goodbye to Riri-chan.
Don’t lie.
Am I lying, being both Amatsuki Suzuna and Yukitsuki Mashiro?
I watched her walk away, a lingering unease in my heart.
98 Misunderstanding
“…Riri-chan, that outfit…”
“It’s your fault, Suzuna, so don’t look at me like that.”
When I met Riri-chan this morning, as usual, her attire had changed.
It was still the school uniform, but her blouse was buttoned up, and her skirt was longer.
A much more… well-behaved look.
Just the uniform, though.
“It’s because you bite my leg.”
She glared at me resentfully.
But honestly, I’m happy about this change.
“Yeah, it makes me want to bite you even more.”
“Absolutely not! I don’t want this anymore!”
Riri-chan clutched her head, ruffling her hair.
She was genuinely displeased.
“…Well, it doesn’t really suit you, but…”
“You’re the one who did it!”
I was scolded.
We entered the school building and walked down the hallway.
The morning air was tense and heavy.
“Hey, about summer break… how about a sleepover?”
She’s as cheerful as ever, completely unaffected by the atmosphere.
“A sleepover…?”
“Yeah, at my place. Or yours, Suzuna.”
It’s true that we both live alone, so there’s no problem with having a sleepover.
Or rather, even if our parents were around, it wouldn’t be strange for two girls to sleep over.
“Okay, but… what are we going to do?”
“Anything.”
“Anything…?”
“Isn’t it fun just being together?”
“Well…”
That might be true.
“We could also go to the beach, since it’s summer.”
“…Huh?”
“Hey, I didn’t say anything weird.”
“There’s nothing to do at the beach.”
“We can swim. I want to see you in a swimsuit, Suzuna.”
“…Absolutely not.”
Why would I subject the public to my pathetic body?
“I think it would be beautiful.”
Riri-chan’s comments have been… suggestive lately.
I think she should calm down a little.
“If you don’t come, I’ll go with Kaede and the others.”
…Riri-chan at the beach?
At the beach in a swimsuit with her cheerful friends.
I can easily imagine her attracting everyone’s attention.
“No.”
“But if you’re not coming, Suzuna, I have no choice, do I?”
“You said you’d cancel all your other plans.”
“You’re the one who canceled on me, so what else can I do?”
She’s saying strange things again.
“No, just no.”
“You won’t go, and you won’t let me go? Aren’t you being a little selfish?”
“I’ll bite you all over if you do.”
That’s how I’ll make sure she can’t expose her skin in a swimsuit.
“Y-You’d go that far…? That’s scary, Suzuna; you’re capable of anything.”
“I’ve told you before, you’re not allowed to show your skin to other people, Riri-chan.”
“Um… it’s a swimsuit.”
“Are you stupid? If it’s not okay even in your uniform, it’s definitely not okay in a swimsuit.”
“W-Well… I don’t think I’m the stupid one…”
Riri-chan scratched her head, muttering, “Good grief…”
I’m the one who wants to do that.
“But why do you want me to cover up so much, Suzuna?”
“It’s not about what I want you to do. You don’t need to show yourself to other people.”
“Like a sheltered princess?”
“It’s fine, I’ll look at you, that’s enough.”
“Hmm?”
“Eh?”
An awkward silence.
I think I said something strange.
“—I can hear an inappropriate conversation about… exposure… which is unsuitable for this time of day.”
“K-Kanaori!”
“Kanaori-san.”
The student council president, frowning, stood behind us.
“It’s fine to be excited about summer break, but you should focus on the final exams first. Especially you.”
Kanaori-san glared at Riri-chan.
“Just let us talk about our plans.”
“That’s how your personal life becomes frivolous, and you neglect your studies.”
“What’s so frivolous about my personal life?”
“Just look at how disheveled your uniform is—wait…”
Kanaori-san realized her own contradiction and trailed off.
Indeed, there was nothing frivolous about her uniform.
“H-Hinase-san… are you being… punished by someone?”
“Why would you think that just because I’m wearing my uniform properly…?”
“I don’t understand how you could be so… compliant after completely ignoring everything I said.”
That’s harsh, Riri-chan.
“It’s her fault.”
Riri-chan pointed at me.
“Ah, Amatsuki-san… what miracle did you use to… fix Hinase-san?”
A miracle…?
I can’t say I bit her…
“Ah… well, all it takes is one word from me.”
One word that shuts her up instantly.
Riri-chan’s knowing gaze was cold.
“Wh-What words of wisdom did you utter? Please enlighten me.”
Ah, this is bad…
I made her even more curious.
And Kanaori-san, while her uniform is now proper, her makeup and nails are still… flashy.
She must have forgotten in her surprise.
◇◇◇
After school.
It was difficult to explain and smooth things over with Kanaori-san after that misunderstanding this morning.
I didn’t expect that exhaustion to last until now…
I should be more careful with my words, being so bad with them.
I packed my textbooks into my bag, wanting to go home quickly.
“Hey, Suzuna?”
A voice called out to me.
It was Shindo-kun.
“What is it? I’m going home.”
“Ah, well, your birthday is during summer break, right? What are you doing this year?”
I was momentarily confused.
“…Ah.”
My birthday as Yukitsuki Mashiro was in June.
Amatsuki Suzuna’s birthday is in August.
My memories are getting mixed up…
Well, it’s fine since I’m not planning on celebrating with Shindo-kun.
“This year, I…”
“—What’s the meaning of this?”
A sharp voice cut in from beside me.
It was Riri-chan.
“Riri…-chan?”
Her demeanor was different from usual.
Heavy, yet with a fragile, strained quality.
“Isn’t Suzuna’s birthday… different?”
“Ah, um…”
This is troublesome…
It’s true that Amatsuki Suzuna’s birthday is in August; it’s easy to find out.
I can’t lie about that.
And I can’t explain Yukitsuki Mashiro’s birthday either.
This is a complicated situation.
“Suzuna, did you lie to me?”
And the timing couldn’t be worse.
I’m betraying the promise we made last night.
------------------ 
99 Lies: Hinase Riri’s Side
“Suzuna’s birthday… isn’t right?”
It was a conversation I couldn’t believe I was having.
“Um, well…”
Suzuna looked away.
She has that habit when something hits a nerve, and she doesn’t even deny it.
“Suzuna, did you lie to me?”
What’s the point of telling me a fake birthday?
Does that mean birthdays don’t matter to her?
Then why did she give me a present on my birthday?
I felt like the necklace was tightening around my neck, choking me.
“Hinase-san, is something wrong with Suzuna?”
Shindo, sitting in front of Suzuna, asked.
Since Suzuna remained silent, it might be faster to ask Shindo.
“When is Suzuna’s birthday?”
“Eh, it’s in August…”
“I see. What were you planning to do for her birthday, Shindo?”
“Well, Suzuna is always alone, so I’ve always celebrated her birthday with her. Every year.”
What?
I’ve never heard of this.
Suzuna never told me.
“Since it’s during summer break, I was checking her schedule to celebrate with her this year too… though she never has any plans.”
Shindo’s tone towards Suzuna was too casual.
It might have been fine before.
But Suzuna is with me now; there’s no way I can allow that.
“H-Hey, Shindo-kun… she didn’t say anything about doing that with you.”
“Huh? We always do.”
“But this year is different…”
I remembered when I asked Suzuna about her plans for summer break yesterday.
“So we’ll be together all of summer break.”
“Yeah, I think it’ll be fine.”
“…You think?”
“Something might come up.”
She gave me such a vague, evasive answer.
I said I’d cancel all my plans.
So this is that “something.”
Their annual birthday celebration.
So she didn’t want me to interfere?
Is that why she told me a fake birthday?
That doesn’t make sense, and I don’t want to believe it.
But how else can I explain this?
“Suzuna, you wanted Shindo to celebrate your birthday that much?”
“No, that’s not it, Riri-chan…”
“Then why did you tell me a fake birthday? What was that about June?”
“That’s… um… well…”
Suzuna just opened and closed her mouth, not offering a proper explanation.
That’s the same as admitting it.
“You did that to Hinase-san? That’s messed up. Hey, Suzuna, you wanted me to celebrate with you that much?”
I’m angry at Suzuna.
But I’m also angry at Shindo.
I’m dating Suzuna, and yet, she’s prioritizing Shindo over me.
A mere childhood friend knows a side of Suzuna that I don’t and is being sought out by her.
There’s nothing more unpleasant than this.
“Shindo, do you know what kind of stuffed animals Suzuna likes?”
I wanted to know what he was planning to get Suzuna for her birthday, if he knew her preferences.
I was being competitive.
“Stuffed animals…? Does Suzuna even like those? She didn’t have any in her room.”
“…”
I was speechless.
It annoys me that he’s been to her house, but…
More than that, I’m shocked that he, Shindo, who’s known Suzuna for so long, said she doesn’t like stuffed animals.
“W-Well, she started liking them recently…”
“Ah, is that so? She suddenly became interested in childish things.”
Come to think of it, the only stuffed animals in Suzuna’s room were the penguins I gave her.
Isn’t it strange for a girl who likes stuffed animals to not have any until she received them as a present?
Just how much of what Suzuna says is true?
“Suzuna, was that also a lie?”
“N-No, it’s not a lie! It’s true!”
Then is Shindo lying?
No, there’s no reason for him to lie.
And come to think of it, Suzuna has been acting strangely since we first met.
“Amatsuki-san, do you like sweets?”
“…I hate them.”
Suzuna liked sweets.
“It’s after school, aren’t you a little hungry?”
“I’m not hungry.”
“Ah, then you must be thirsty, right? We ran quite a bit, and you were out of breath, Amatsuki-san.”
“I’m not thirsty.”
She lied so casually.
Could it be that she’s been lying all along?
The stuffed animals were a lie.
Her birthday was a lie.
And her feelings for me are also a lie—
“…I see. Okay.”
This is bad.
If I stay here, I’ll do something I’ll regret.
I can’t stay here.
“Riri-chan, wait!”
Suzuna, raising her voice unusually, grabbed my wrist.
But I don’t want to be touched by that hand right now.
“Let go.”
I shook off Suzuna’s hand.
“Eh…”
Suzuna’s sad voice.
It made my chest ache.
But this is my pain.
There’s no worse betrayal than this.
I didn’t look at Suzuna and ran out into the hallway.
◇◇◇
“R-Riri-chan!”
As I was walking home, I heard a voice calling out to me.
I turned around, and there was Suzuna, out of breath and without her bag.
“…What?”
I’m not sure I can talk to her calmly right now.
“Listen, what happened earlier… is different.”
“Different how…?”
“What Shindo-kun said… is completely wrong.”
Suzuna will probably try to explain everything, saying it was a misunderstanding.
But that’s not the issue.
Suzuna has been hiding things about Shindo, not telling me the truth.
That feeling of dissonance has always been there.
And now, the truth has been revealed.
Maybe there really is a misunderstanding.
But…
“How am I supposed to believe that?”
“That’s what I’m trying to—”
“Can you honestly say you’ve been telling me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, Suzuna?”
“…!”
Suzuna immediately fell silent at those words.
See, that’s the answer.
If what Shindo said was truly a misunderstanding…
She wouldn’t have fallen silent just from that one question.
Even if everything else wasn’t a lie, there’s a real lie somewhere, that’s why she’s silent.
I can tell just from looking at her.
I can understand just from her reaction because I’ve been watching her closely.
“You said, ‘I’m on your side, Suzuna. Tell me anything.’ And ‘Don’t lie.’”
“That’s…”
Suzuna remained silent, looking down.
“You’re human, so I understand that you can’t always tell the truth. But… I don’t understand this. I don’t understand why you’d lie about this.”
“…”
I still wanted her to deny it.
Even if it was a lie, I wanted her to deny everything.
I wanted her to say there was a reason.
But she’s not doing that because she feels guilty, probably.
“I don’t think I can… be with you for a while, Suzuna.”
“…Okay.”
She gives up so easily.
If she really liked me, loved me, wouldn’t she hold on?
Wouldn’t she try to stop me?
I wanted someone who would always be with me.
100 Retribution
“Suzuna, did you lie to me?”
I couldn’t answer her accusing question.
“Suzuna, you wanted Shindo to celebrate your birthday that much?”
That’s not true.
I don’t want Shindo-kun to celebrate my birthday at all.
“Then why did you tell me a fake birthday? What was that about June?”
I can’t tell her.
How can I explain something as nonsensical as being a reincarnator?
How can I make her believe me?
“Shindo, do you know what kind of stuffed animals Suzuna likes?”
“Stuffed animals…? Does Suzuna even like those? She didn’t have any in her room.”
Hurt and confusion flickered in Riri-chan’s eyes.
No, that’s not right!
That’s Amatsuki Suzuna, not me, Yukitsuki Mashiro!
“Suzuna, was that also a lie?”
“N-No, it’s not a lie! It’s true!”
But it was too late.
The accumulated lies and misunderstandings intertwined, obscuring the truth.
The person reflected in Riri-chan’s eyes was a liar.
Her downcast gaze no longer met mine.
“Riri-chan, wait!”
I grabbed her wrist as she turned to leave.
“Let go.”
She shook off my hand.
It was the first time Riri-chan rejected me.
It hurt.
Not my hand, but my chest, my heart.
But I couldn’t stop myself from chasing after her.
I desperately pursued her.
◇◇◇
I finally caught up to her and made her turn around.
She usually forgives me easily.
“Suzuna, can you honestly say you’ve been telling me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”
I can’t.
Because my very existence is a lie.
I don’t know how to explain anything.
Denying Amatsuki Suzuna and revealing Yukitsuki Mashiro…
It’s too late for that now.
“You said, ‘I’m on your side, Suzuna. Tell me anything.’ And ‘Don’t lie.’”
I couldn’t tell her because of that trust.
I couldn’t deny the “Amatsuki Suzuna” she knew.
I didn’t have the confidence that she’d still like me after knowing the real me.
“You’re human, so I understand that you can’t always tell the truth. But… I don’t understand this. I don’t understand why you’d lie about this.”
I don’t understand either.
I didn’t want this to happen.
“I don’t think I can… be with you for a while, Suzuna.”
Rejection.
Riri-chan, who has always been with me, is letting go of my hand.
No.
Pain, suffering, sadness, loneliness, fear.
A whirlpool of negative emotions. I wanted to grab her hand, the hand that saved me from them.
“…Okay.”
But I realized something.
I don’t have the right to wish for that.
How many times have I rejected Riri-chan like this since we met?
And every time, she never showed any displeasure, always staying by my side.
How much pain have I caused her, how oblivious have I been?
I can’t forgive myself for finally realizing it now.
◇◇◇
The next morning, I was alone.
There was a message from Riri-chan on my phone: “Let’s go to school separately for a while.”
A short, simple, and indifferent message.
She usually sends emojis, emoticons, and stickers.
Just that one line made the distance between us feel real.
I don’t want to go.
I don’t want to go to school alone.
I’m not sure I can handle the loneliness.
But maybe something will change if I go to school.
Believing that, I forced my leaden body to move.
◇◇◇
“…Eh?”
That faint hope was immediately crushed.
Riri-chan’s blouse was unbuttoned, and her skirt was short again.
The necklace was gone, and so was the bite mark on her leg.
Those were the things that bound her to me, the proof that she was mine.
The fact that she discarded them all means she doesn’t want to keep any trace of me.
It means she’s abandoned me.
Stunned, I sat down at my desk alone.
It’s been a while since I’ve been alone and silent in the noisy classroom.
◇◇◇
Lunch break.
“Hey, Riri, aren’t you eating lunch with Amatsuki today?”
I heard Kaede-san’s voice.
“Ah… yeah. I wanted to eat with everyone for a change.”
Riri-chan casually blended in with her friends.
It’s fine, she just reverted to her former self.
I’ll get used to it soon.
“…Ah.”
I forgot to prepare lunch.
I always forgot because Riri-chan made it for me.
Just as I was telling myself it was okay… this happened.
A sudden error.
I wasn’t particularly hungry, but I couldn’t stay in the classroom.
I don’t have lunch, so I’ll go to the school store and buy something.
I told myself that without any real conviction and stood up.
I walked past Riri-chan and her friends.
I could hear their voices, but I couldn’t look at them.
What if I made eye contact with Riri-chan, and she looked away?
What if she’s lost all interest in me and won’t even look at me?
I’m afraid of finding out.
I left the classroom as if running away.
◇◇◇
After school.
I was alone in the classroom.
I didn’t have the courage to go home yet.
…Or rather, I was holding onto a faint hope.
That maybe… Riri-chan would call out to me.
That maybe… she’d forgive me.
But that didn’t happen.
Riri-chan left school with Tachibana-san and the others.
It’s only natural.
I’m the strange one, clinging to hope.
Riri-chan once patted my head when I was feeling down on an evening like this.
She won’t do that anymore.
I gave up and left the classroom.
◇◇◇
I went down the stairs.
This landing is where Riri-chan and I first kissed cheeks.
I walked towards the entrance.
That wall is where Riri-chan leaned against, waiting for me.
I passed by the park.
That’s where we promised to celebrate her birthday and shared our first deep kiss.
The corner of the residential street.
That’s where Riri-chan, jealous of my past, kissed me almost angrily.
The downtown area.
That’s where Riri-chan—
My vision blurred.
“No matter… where I go… you’re there…”
The dazzling setting sun and the blurring scenery overwhelmed me, and the world crumbled.
Riri-chan isn’t here.
And yet, she’s everywhere I look.
Even when I try to push her out of my mind, the memories etched into my heart call out to her.
If I keep indulging in these memories, I’ll drown in them.
Wiping away the tears, I ignored everything and went home.
If I return to a world consisting only of myself, I might be able to endure this.
As if driven by instinct, I climbed the stairs and fled to my room.
“…Ah.”
It’s no use.
The two pairs of penguin plushies were lying on the bed.
The present Riri-chan gave me for my birthday, Yukitsuki Mashiro’s birthday.
Riri-chan’s presence is everywhere.
She won’t let me erase her from my memory.
“…Ugh…”
I collapsed onto my knees and hugged the plushies.
Something within me broke, and tears streamed down my face.
My chest ached, and I couldn’t stop sobbing.
I was supposed to be fine alone.
I wasn’t supposed to want to be involved with anyone.
Riri-chan isn’t here.
And the world has lost its color.
I shouldn’t have known.
If it’s this painful, this agonizing, this sad, this lonely, this terrifying…
I should have stayed alone forever.
------------------ 
101 I Hate You Because I Like You: Hinase Riri’s Side
“Hey, Riri, did you have a fight with Amatsuki?”
As we were walking home after school, Kaede teased me as soon as we were alone.
“What are you talking about?”
“You didn’t talk to Amatsuki at all today.”
“It’s just a coincidence.”
“And you’re not wearing the necklace she gave you. You even buttoned up your blouse yesterday to wear it.”
Ugh…
I was stupid for bragging to Kaede about it yesterday…
“‘Hey, look! Suzuna gave this to me for my birthday. Isn’t it amazing?!’”
Kaede mimicked me in a cutesy voice, her hand next to her face.
That wasn’t her usual tone.
“What was that? Are you imitating me?”
“Yeah, you from yesterday. Similar, right?”
The sudden shift back to her usual tone and demeanor was jarring.
“Not at all! I wasn’t that… giddy.”
“You were even more… lovestruck than my imitation just now.”
“What do you mean, ‘lovestruck’?”
“Like a pet happily receiving a treat.”
“That’s annoying.”
But was I really that giddy?
Kaede teases me sometimes, but she’s not the type to exaggerate and make fun of me.
I must have been acting that way.
“I just happened to forget the necklace.”
“Hmm. Happened to, huh…”
She can’t deny it if I say that.
This conversation is over.
“Then why did you bring two bentos today?”
“That’s… just out of habit…”
I spaced out and unconsciously made two bentos and packed them in my bag.
Habits are scary.
“Well, even if you’re not eating together, you could have given one to Amatsuki.”
“That’s…”
“Amatsuki left the classroom quickly during lunch break, didn’t she? Did she go to the school store to buy something?”
“I… guess?”
I don’t know what she was doing; she didn’t come back to the classroom until class started.
“Well, if you know, you should give it to her.”
“She was… gone.”
“You usually rush to her no matter where she is.”
“Ugh…”
Kaede kept cornering me, no matter how I answered.
“You knew she walked past, but you deliberately pretended not to notice.”
“…That’s just your imagination, Kaede.”
“You’re always staring at her, and you say that?”
Just how much does Kaede observe me?
That’s scary.
“You’re not walking to and from school together, you’re not giving her your bento, you’re not making eye contact, and you’re not talking to her. What do you think that looks like objectively?”
I couldn’t think of a response to that list.
“You had a fight, didn’t you?”
“…It’s Suzuna’s fault.”
I gave up on trying to deceive Kaede.
◇◇◇
“You’re so childish…”
After I briefly explained what happened, Kaede sighed, looking exasperated.
“Who are you calling childish?”
“You, Riri.”
“Me?”
“She just told you the wrong birthday.”
She doesn’t understand.
The unsentimental Kaede doesn’t understand how important that is.
“Doesn’t that make you wonder? Why would she tell you the wrong birthday?”
“Well, that’s definitely strange, but…”
“So?”
“But did you ask her why?”
“…There’s no way I’d understand even if I asked.”
“If she’s doing something that strange, there might be a deeper reason. You should try to understand.”
“Shindo said he was going to celebrate her real birthday. Don’t you think she gave me a fake date because she didn’t want me to interfere?”
That’s right.
They have a strange, close relationship, so she probably thought I was in the way.
“Did… Amatsuki say that?”
“…She didn’t, but… she wouldn’t say that out loud.”
“Hmm, Riri…”
Kaede put her arm around my shoulder.
“You’re… a bit heavy.”
“No, you’re the heavy one…”
What is she saying, leaning on me like that?
“That’s not what I mean. Getting so worked up just because she lied to you, getting angry just because her childhood friend said he’d celebrate with her… Calm down.”
“That’s because you’re not involved, Kaede…”
“With lies, isn’t the reason behind them more important? Amatsuki might have had a reason for doing that. I think you should find out.”
“…That’s…”
“And about Shindo… wasn’t Amatsuki trying to… refuse him?”
“Anyone can say that.”
Kaede shook her head.
“Seriously, I’m listening to your incredibly trivial lovers’ quarrel, and that’s how you respond?”
“L-Lovers’ quarrel…?!”
I haven’t told anyone that I’m dating Suzuna.
“You’re obviously in love with Amatsuki. Your love is too heavy.”
“A-Ahaha… you’re being funny, Kaede.”
“You make her lunch, you get angry when she lies to you, you’re jealous of her interactions with her ex, you’re happy about her present, and you take it off when you’re upset.”
“…”
“You’re clearly Amatsuki’s girl, Riri.”
“S-Suzuna is also a girl!”
Kaede poked my chest.
“And this… you’re not secretly showing it off without wearing it, hoping that Amatsuki will tell you to put it back on, are you?”
“…H-Hey, that’s not…”
“I know you have the necklace in your bag, ready to wear it anytime.”
“…?! You looked in my bag?!”
“No, it was a lucky guess.”
“…Seriously…”
Kaede grinned mischievously.
“Rejecting him and then creating a reason for her to approach you… that’s sly. I thought you were more straightforward, Riri, but you’re so clingy when it comes to love.”
“That’s not true!”
What, what is this?!
Well, it’s not like I didn’t consider that possibility…
And I did show my leg, which still has a faint mark.
I did think that Suzuna might get angry and confront me.
But that was just a possibility.
That’s not what I wanted.
“Getting this worked up about it is proof that you like her. Do you know how easily love and hate can be converted?”
Kaede’s interrogation showed no signs of stopping.
Can’t she just let it go…?
“Just make up with her already.”
“I’m not going to do that just because you told me to!”
“It’s affecting us too, you know.”
“Why?”
“You were always in a good mood when you were getting along with Amatsuki, but you’ve been so gloomy since your fight. Do you know that everyone was walking on eggshells around you today?”
“I was acting normally.”
“You were constantly fidgeting, barely responding to anyone, sighing all the time, and then you suddenly started pulling your hair out.”
“It’s a habit!”
“A habit you have when you’re in a bad mood.”
“…Shut up!”
Kaede just kept laughing.
“Well, I find it amusing, so I don’t really care. But you’ll wear yourself out if you keep this up, Riri. Just a friendly advice.”
“Okay, okay, thank you. But I’m not going to forgive Suzuna until she apologizes.”
“You’re just putting on a brave face. You’ll forgive her immediately if she apologizes, won’t you?”
“…”
“Amatsuki must have a hard time being the emotional support for such a troublesome person.”
I’m not troublesome!
It’s Suzuna’s fault for not saying anything!
Chapter 102: Looking Down
It had been a few days since I last spoke to Riri-chan.
Final exams had begun.
School life, proceeding monotonously with the tests, offered fewer opportunities to talk to people than usual.
That made it a little easier to bear the loneliness of being alone.
So even though I usually hate tests, I’m grateful for them now.
Time passed, but the weight in my chest remained.
I tried to exhale, hoping to lighten the burden, but nothing changed.
Tomorrow is the last day of the final exams.
The closing ceremony will soon follow, and then summer break.
And I’ll continue living my life… without Riri-chan.
I’ll get used to it, surely.
I spent each day believing that.
◇◇◇
Lunch break arrived.
I immediately left the classroom and headed for the school store.
After buying a sandwich, I didn’t return to the classroom but went up the stairs.
Opening the door to the rooftop, a dazzlingly blue sky spread before me.
The sunlight was strong, its heat scorching my skin.
I wished there was at least a breeze.
“Oh, you’re here again.”
Futaba Yuu was on the rooftop.
“…Hello.”
I gave a slight bow and sat down as far away from her as possible.
There were no benches, so I sat directly on the floor.
Since Riri-chan started ignoring me, I’ve been spending my lunch breaks here.
I don’t like it because I’ll get sunburned, and it’s hot, but…
There are people everywhere else, so this is the only place I can be alone.
The only person eccentric enough to be on the rooftop at this time of year is the senpai heroine in front of me.
“Shouldn’t you tell me by now?”
Futaba-senpai was leaning against the railing, holding a carton of juice in her right hand.
“…Tell you what?”
I opened my sandwich.
“Why you’ve been coming here every day lately.”
“I don’t want to.”
“Well, you refused to tell me the first time too, but if this continues, I’m going to get… curious.”
When I came here the first time, she asked the same question, and I didn’t answer. Futaba-senpai, seemingly understanding, kept quiet.
Thanks to that, I was able to spend my lunch breaks here in peace. But today, she’s pressing me for an answer.
I took a bite of my sandwich.
The bread was fluffy, and the egg filling was sweet.
“Do you like this place?”
I was trying to remain silent, but Futaba-senpai was being persistent.
She must have been holding back for quite a while, considering she kept quiet for several days.
“I don’t like school in general.”
I don’t really want to talk to her either.
But now that some time has passed, and my feelings for Riri-chan have calmed down, I have a little more room to talk.
And it’s tiring to keep ignoring someone who’s talking to you, so I guess I have no choice but to answer.
“Hmm, same here.”
“…How are we the same?”
“You’re here because you want to be alone.”
“…”
It’s not like Futaba Yuu doesn’t have any friends.
She’s just eccentric, preferring to be alone during lunch break.
She’s different from me, someone who can’t fit in with a group.
“Oh, was I wrong?”
If anything, we’re the opposite.
I’m alone because I’m looking for a place where I can be alone without being bothered by other people’s gazes.
“…I’m here because I can be alone in peace.”
“Ah, I see.”
She nodded, saying, “I see, I see,” and then there was a short silence.
“But that’s contradictory, isn’t it?”
“What is?”
Futaba-senpai was talkative today.
Maybe I shouldn’t have answered her.
I should have just kept quiet.
“If you don’t like being at school and you don’t like being alone, then you should be with someone, right?”
She’s saying such obvious things again…
People like her can’t understand how a lonely introvert feels.
“It wouldn’t be a problem if I could do that.”
“What about that girl? Hinase Riri-chan. You were close, weren’t you?”
She brought up the name I least wanted to hear right now.
“…”
“Are you not getting along with her?”
“…I don’t want to talk about it.”
“That’s the same as saying yes.”
Futaba-senpai smiled.
I’m not trying to entertain her.
“I see, so that’s why you’re uncomfortable being here.”
The dry sound of footsteps.
I looked to the side, and Futaba-senpai was approaching.
“…What is it?”
I looked up, but the sun was behind her, so I couldn’t see her face clearly.
“Then how about… I become your place?”
“…Excuse me?”
“If you’ve lost your place with Hinase-chan, I’ll be your place.”
I don’t understand what she means.
“If you don’t like being in the classroom, you can come here every day. I’ll keep you company.”
“…What about when it rains or snows?”
“Then I’ll come to your classroom, Suzuna-chan. You can come here too, of course.”
Would that… fill this loneliness, even a little?
“The fact that you spent time with me here means you think there’s a possibility of us… being together, right?”
…Honestly, I’m just here because there’s nowhere else to go.
But maybe I can see it that way.
“You’re lonely, aren’t you?”
If this were the past me, the me before I met Riri-chan…
I would have been able to be alone in the classroom.
It was normal, so it was fine.
But Riri-chan changed that.
Now that I know what it’s like to be with someone, I can’t bear to be alone anymore.
When did I become so weak?
“Um, why are you doing this for me?”
The one thing I didn’t understand was Futaba-senpai’s motive.
“I told you when we first met, didn’t I? ‘Because you seem interesting.’”
“…I see.”
But would I be able to… relax if I did that?
Would the weight in my chest disappear?
Would this loneliness be filled?
“It’s not easy, is it?”
“…Well, no, it’s not.”
“Tell me your answer tomorrow.”
“That’s… rushing me.”
“You can find the answer within yourself in a day.”
That’s easy for her to say.
I’m not the type of person who can understand myself that well.
That’s why I hurt Riri-chan with my ambiguous attitude.
“Then I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Futaba-senpai waved and left.
I still don’t know what to do.
------------------ 
103 The Answer Lies Within
I couldn’t concentrate on the afternoon test.
Futaba-senpai’s words, “How about I become your place?” wouldn’t leave my mind.
I wasn’t thinking about that at all, but her words made me waver.
Maybe it’s okay… if I can escape this loneliness.
That thought surfaced.
But I also wondered if it was truly the right thing to do.
I don’t know how to reconcile these feelings since I’ve never experienced this before.
All I know is that I’m confused.
I hated myself for being so easily swayed, for my feelings for Riri-chan, which I thought were so resolute, being so fragile.
The test ended without me finding an answer.
◇◇◇
After school.
I stayed until the very end, as usual, and then headed home.
The school was very quiet without the after-school club activities.
I walked alone down the silent hallway.
Tomorrow is the last day of the final exams, followed immediately by the closing ceremony.
Summer break will begin, and I won’t see Riri-chan.
I don’t think I can spend those days alone.
Then, maybe…
“—Oh, Amatsuki-san?”
A clear voice echoed through the hallway.
I turned around, and there was Kanaori Reika.
“You’re leaving quite late for a test day.”
“You too, Kanaori-san.”
“I was waiting for someone, and…”
Kanaori-san’s expression hardened noticeably.
I could sense her irritation.
“Waiting for… someone…?”
“Hinase Riri. I told her to come to the student council room after school, but she didn’t show up.”
“Ah, I-I see…”
The person I least want to talk about right now…
The timing is terrible.
“I was so impressed that she finally corrected her uniform, but she’s reverted back to her old ways.”
“Th-That’s true…”
“Thanks to your encouragement, Amatsuki-san, she finally started looking like a proper student. This is… a betrayal, even to you. I can’t believe it.”
“Well, that’s…”
It’s true that I influenced her to correct her uniform.
But it’s also my fault that she reverted…
I can’t say that, though.
“And after I called her out to give her another warning, she stood me up. I don’t know what to do anymore.”
“I-I see…”
It seems like Riri-chan is a constant source of trouble for Kanaori-san.
“Ah, that’s right!”
Kanaori-san suddenly clasped her hands together, as if she had an idea.
“What is it?”
“I have a favor to ask. Could you… convey a message to her, Amatsuki-san?”
My heart pounded with a sense of foreboding.
“Convey… what…?”
“If possible, I’d like you to… ask her to correct her uniform.”
Kanaori-san was watching my reaction closely.
“Well, that’s… a bit…”
“Yes, I understand. I don’t want to cause any trouble between you two, so I won’t insist if it’s too difficult. I’m fine being the bad guy.”
I’m impressed by her resolve.
“Then I’d like you to tell Hinase-san to come to the student council room after school tomorrow, without fail.”
She’s being so polite and humble that it’s hard to refuse…
But… I can’t do that right now.
“I’m sure she’ll listen to you, Amatsuki-san. I apologize for asking, but could you please cooperate?”
“Well, that’s… a little…”
Kanaori-san tilted her head at my hesitant response.
“I thought you’d agree, Amatsuki-san, since you were the one who helped Hinase-san correct her uniform…”
“Well, I… I do feel that way too, but…”
There’s a problem that occurred before that, and I can’t do anything about it.
“Did something happen between you and Hinase-san?”
Kanaori-san quickly noticed my hesitation.
“Um… yes.”
Unable to come up with a plausible excuse, I just admitted it.
“That’s unusual for you two. Did you have a fight?”
“Ah… well… something like that.”
“I see… Then this isn’t the time to be asking for favors.”
Kanaori-san looked awkward and twirled a strand of her golden hair around her finger.
“Since when? You two seemed to be getting along well when I saw you the other day.”
“It happened after that.”
“Did Hinase-san do something?”
It’s probably because of their relationship that Kanaori-san immediately suspects Riri-chan…
“No, it’s my fault. I kept lying to her, and she found out and got angry.”
“Lying…? You, Amatsuki-san?”
“Yes. I think she doesn’t trust me anymore. She hasn’t talked to me since then.”
“That’s…”
Kanaori-san put the strand of hair she was twirling to her lips, thought for a moment, and then let go.
“Is it okay… to leave things like that?”
“Um… well, it’s… too late now, I think.”
“Too late?”
“I’ve been lying from the beginning. I’d have to explain everything from when we first met. And who would want to listen to someone who’s built on lies? She probably doesn’t trust me anymore.”
“But if you don’t talk to her, Amatsuki-san, won’t this situation continue?”
“…Yes.”
“Is it okay for you to become estranged from Hinase-san?”
I think Kanaori-san is genuinely worried.
But hearing her say it directly made my heart ache.
“I’m sure she doesn’t want to talk to me. And Riri-chan has lots of friends, so it doesn’t matter if I’m gone.”
“…What about you?”
“I… have someone else who said they’d be with me. So I thought I could… rely on that person…”
Putting my wavering feelings into words gradually gave them shape.
I started to think that maybe… this was the right answer.
“—Then, how about I—”
“Eh?”
Kanaori-san took a step forward, her voice filled with passion.
But then she stopped.
She bit her lip as if coming back to her senses and took a step back.
“…No, that won’t be good for you, Amatsuki-san.”
“For me?”
I didn’t understand what she meant.
“Were your lies… malicious?”
“That’s…”
That’s definitely not true.
It was difficult for me to accept my situation at first, and I didn’t think she’d believe me.
It was closer to resignation than malice.
“If that’s the case, I think you should tell her the truth.”
“Tell her the truth…? But it’s too late now…”
“It might be too late for you, Amatsuki-san, but it might not be too late for Hinase-san.”
“But she wouldn’t even listen to me…”
She brushed off my hand, walked away, and told me she couldn’t be with me.
“She might be waiting for you to try to talk to her again.”
“…I don’t know about that.”
“Yes, you don’t. But it’s not impossible, is it?”
“You’re surprisingly optimistic, Kanaori-san.”
“That’s not true, Amatsuki-san.”
She took a light step forward, as if bouncing.
Kanaori-san’s demeanor had changed, a more gentle approach.
Her expression was slightly sad, but there was a smile on her lips.
“You’re just… afraid of getting hurt.”
“Afraid of getting hurt…?”
“Yes, because you wouldn’t be thinking about… replacing her with someone else, would you?”
“I… don’t know.”
“No, you want to be with Hinase-san.”
I don’t understand how she can be so sure.
“How can you say that?”
“I can tell. Because, Amatsuki-san… your expression and your eyes don’t change when you talk about anyone else, but they immediately change when you talk about Hinase-san.”
“…Eh?”
“It’s simple, I can tell just from looking at you.”
What amazing observation skills.
“Your expression and your eyes didn’t change when you talked about the other person who said they’d be with you. So your feelings should be clear, Amatsuki-san.”
“But I don’t know what to do…”
She tapped my chest with her finger.
“The answer lies within your heart.”
“…Um…”
That’s a rather abstract answer for Kanaori-san.
“You should be more honest with yourself, Amatsuki-san.”
“Is that so…?”
“Yes. You should practice… expressing your feelings.”
“Expressing my feelings? Practice?”
“Yes, for example… you could tell me who that… lover you mentioned earlier is…?”
“Eh?!”
Why did the conversation suddenly shift to romance…?
This should just be a friend’s relationship troubles for her.
“See? Your eyes sparkled, and your expression brightened.”
“Um, th-that’s because…”
Since she said my expression changes when I talk about Riri-chan, she must already know…
“Fufu, I’m right, aren’t I?”
“Um… you knew?”
“I’ve been observing Hinase-san, for better or worse… and you too.”
“I see…”
As expected of Kanaori-san.
I can’t compete with her perceptiveness.
“You should learn to like yourself more, Amatsuki-san. And open your heart and show your true self.”
“Is that… really okay…?”
It seems simple, but it’s difficult.
And I don’t think it’s something I’m allowed to do…
“I think you’ll change, surely.”
Kanaori-san removed her hand from my chest and walked away.
Perhaps because of her touch, the weight in my chest felt a little lighter.
104 Resolving to…
The last day of final exams.
Time flew by, and summer vacation was almost here.
Before that, I have to find an answer.
Kanaori-san told me the answer lies within myself, so—
◇◇◇
Lunch break.
Today, I didn’t go to the school store. I walked slowly towards the rooftop.
My lack of appetite probably means I’m nervous.
Opening the door, there was the same clear sky as yesterday, and a girl standing there.
“Oh, you came again today.”
“That’s what I said yesterday, didn’t I?”
“I thought you might ignore me.”
Futaba-senpai, as always, was relaxed.
She’s naturally carefree, but I wonder where she gets that composure from.
“I wouldn’t ignore you. I couldn’t, not after you said that to me.”
I couldn’t just brush her off after she offered me such kind words.
“Then can I hear your answer?”
“That’s sudden.”
“We can’t have a proper chat until we’re done with the main topic.”
“That’s… true.”
I asked myself.
What do I want?
But I already knew the answer.
Because the reason I’m so hurt and unable to move on is that that person is more important to me than anyone else.
There’s no replacing her.
I can’t just fill the void with someone else; that would be unfair to Futaba-senpai.
I steeled my resolve and looked at Futaba-senpai.
Today, we were at eye level, and the sun wasn’t obscuring her expression.
“Thank you, Futaba-senpai. I was happy that you offered me such kind words.”
I expressed my honest feelings and bowed my head.
“Well, I just did what I wanted to do.”
Futaba-senpai’s tone remained unchanged.
I couldn’t tell what she was thinking.
But—
“But I can’t… rely on you, senpai.”
I looked up and said it clearly.
Futaba-senpai’s eyes widened slightly, and then she returned to her usual relaxed smile.
“Am I not good enough?”
“No, it’s not like that.”
I don’t have the right to say such arrogant things.
It’s much simpler than that.
“I… can’t give up.”
Even after being rejected, having her let go of my hand, and losing my place…
I still kept coming here.
I could have given up at any time.
But I endured because I was holding onto hope.
“You can’t forget about her, can you?”
“No, I can’t.”
“She might reject you again, you know?”
“Even so, that’s not a reason to rely on you, Futaba-senpai… or rather, I shouldn’t.”
I shouldn’t lean on someone when I don’t have feelings for them.
It might offer temporary comfort, but I think that kind of relationship would gradually become distorted.
“Okay, okay, then good luck.”
Futaba-senpai smiled cheerfully.
“…You’re not… angry?”
“Why would I be?”
“Well, I ended up rejecting you after you tried to help me…”
It must be painful for her that I didn’t take her offered hand.
“Don’t you remember, Suzuna-chan?”
“…Yes?”
“I’m interested in… interesting things.”
“…I see.”
I’ve heard her say that since we first met, but…
“There are things that are interesting precisely because they’re out of reach.”
It was a typical Futaba-senpai-like remark.
I couldn’t tell if she was being sincere or just trying to be considerate.
◇◇◇
My mind was made up.
I’ll talk to Riri-chan again.
I don’t know if she’ll even look at me.
But I don’t want to have any more regrets.
I returned to the classroom and sat down at my desk.
“Shindo-kun.”
But there’s one more thing I have to do before that.
“What is it, Suzuna? I’m trying to memorize vocabulary right now, so if you’re going to talk to me, speak English.”
This guy…
Neither of us is good at English…
“Do you have some time after school?”
“…Yeah, but what’s wrong?”
“I need to talk to you.”
Perhaps sensing my seriousness, he looked at me without his usual teasing tone.
“What’s with the serious face?”
“It’s about… the future.”
“…Okay.”
He seemed puzzled, but…
Shindo-kun nodded and looked back at his textbook.
—Thud
Something fell to the floor.
“…Hmm?”
I saw a designer wallet on the floor.
(I’m not fashionable enough to know the brand, but I can tell it’s expensive.)
I picked it up.
“Ah, sorry.”
I looked up, and Tachibana-san was looking at me.
It seems to be hers.
“Here.”
“Ah, thanks…”
I handed it to her, and she returned to her seat.
◇◇◇
After school.
Shindo-kun and I were the only ones left in the classroom.
“…So, what is it, Suzuna? Making me stay until the very end after finally being freed from tests…”
“I’m really sorry about that.”
“…Just tell me what you want.”
I’ve been avoiding confronting Shindo Minato, the protagonist.
I’ve only tried to set him up with other heroines, avoiding direct conversation with him.
But in the end, I, Amatsuki Suzuna, am the one who remained.
That was my mistake, I think.
“About summer break… you don’t have to celebrate my birthday with me.”
“…Ah, okay.”
“Yeah, we’re still childhood friends, but… you don’t have to do anything special.”
“…What’s wrong? Do you want to be alone?”
Shindo-kun’s expression was a mixture of surprise and concern.
He’s probably worried about me.
But I shouldn’t have ignored this.
“I… have someone I like.”
“…Seriously?”
His voice rose in surprise.
“Yeah, so… I want to be with that person… all the time, if possible.”
“…H-Hmm… you, Suzuna, have someone you like… hmm…”
Shindo-kun’s voice trailed off.
I don’t know how strong his feelings for Amatsuki Suzuna are right now.
But surely, the feelings he’s harbored since childhood aren’t zero.
After all, there’s an Amatsuki Suzuna route as an ending option.
So instead of pushing the responsibility onto someone else, I should have clearly severed my ties with him.
That’s the only way I, Yukitsuki Mashiro, can escape the entanglement with Shindo Minato and Amatsuki Suzuna.
Otherwise, I shouldn’t be facing Riri-chan.
“I see, I see… you’ve really changed, haven’t you? So that’s what it was.”
“Yeah, that’s it.”
Shindo-kun nodded repeatedly, as if trying to convince himself.
“Okay, I understand.”
“Really…?”
What I’m saying is severing the ties between Shindo Minato and Amatsuki Suzuna.
I didn’t expect him to accept it so readily.
“We’re childhood friends, stuck together. I can tell when you’re serious, and I’m not insensitive enough to deny that.”
Shindo-kun held out his fist.
He probably wants a fist bump.
But that’s not something you do with a girl…
“Thank you.”
Even so, I held out my fist, feeling embarrassed.
To thank Shindo-kun for understanding.
His fist, unexpectedly hard, bumped against mine.
Good.
Now, all that’s left is… Riri-chan…
—Screech!
“Eh…?”
There was a noise from the door leading to the hallway.
A flash of brown hair reflected in the window, then disappeared.
But I instinctively knew.
It’s Riri-chan.
It must be.
She was there.
“Go, Suzuna.”
“Eh, Shindo-kun, did you know who it was?”
It was just a glimpse of her hair.
“Not at all.”
“Then why did you say that…?”
“Because… it’s usually you in these kinds of situations, isn’t it?”
“…”
He’s so careless and unreliable, and yet…
My hesitation vanished.
Thinking that this was the moment, I ran out into the hallway.
------------------ 
105 As Time Passes By: Hinase Riri’s Side
Near the end of lunch break.
Kaede and I, fed up with the heat, decided to buy some juice from the vending machine on the first floor.
I was holding an orange soda, and Kaede had a sports drink.
We were on our way back.
“You chose that on purpose?”
I didn’t understand the point of buying a sports drink.
“It’s not good for you.”
Kaede criticized my carbonated drink.
“You’re worried about that?”
“You should be, at least a little. You’re not going to stay young forever, and it’s not good for your skin when you get older.”
It felt like she was different from me, already thinking about the distant future when we’re still teenagers.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m only going to live for today.”
“I know.”
Kaede accepted it without any objection.
That’s not very interesting.
“Why do you understand me so well, Kaede?”
“If you were the type who thinks about tomorrow, you wouldn’t be giving your crush the silent treatment for a week.”
“Ugh…”
I tried to be a little mean, but she completely turned it back on me.
“How long are you going to be stubborn? You should just talk to Amatsuki and clear up any misunderstandings.”
“I’m telling you, I want Suzuna to be the one to talk to me. If she really cares about me, she’ll definitely try to clear up the misunderstanding.”
Kaede frowned at my reply.
“That’s so tiring. Are you a clingy girlfriend?”
“That’s annoying.”
That’s a harsh reaction after asking me.
I didn’t say that because I wanted to.
“And Suzuna might have tried to clear up the misunderstanding, but you’re the one who rejected her. There’s no way she’ll approach you now.”
“That’s why I’m saying she should try harder.”
“…Think about Suzuna’s personality. She’s not exactly assertive.”
That’s true, but…
I don’t want her to talk about Suzuna’s personality as if she understands her perfectly.
“You don’t know anything about Suzuna’s personality, Kaede, so stop saying such irresponsible things.”
“Ah, possessiveness? You’re ignoring her, but you don’t want anyone else to touch her? Ouch, that hurts…”
Kaede dramatically closed her eyes, as if I had said something incredibly painful.
It’s not very amusing since I can’t deny any of it.
“It’s fine. If she gives up that easily, then that’s how much she cares about me.”
“You’re not being honest. You actually want her attention.”
“Why do you understand me so well, Kaede?!”
“Because there are so many things you do that make me think that way, Riri. Want to hear them?”
She’s observing me that closely?
I don’t know if it’s because Kaede is perceptive or if I’m being too obvious, but…
“No, I don’t.”
“Wise decision.”
Kaede shook her head.
“Seriously, are you sure you can afford to be so nonchalant?”
“…What do you mean?”
“Amatsuki is also a girl, you know? What if she wants someone to comfort her broken heart?”
“Who?”
“I don’t know. But Amatsuki has become more polished lately, thanks to someone, so I think there are probably people interested in her.”
Kaede is perceptive, noticing everything from the reactions of those around us to individual changes.
If Kaede says so, then it’s highly likely.
“No… she wouldn’t change her mind so quickly.”
“I’ve seen a lot of friends lose someone they like because they were too hesitant.”
“…”
Kaede’s words made me feel uneasy.
“If you’re getting this flustered just from what I said, you should make up with her quickly.”
“It’s fine. I’m waiting.”
Kaede sighed deeply.
◇◇◇
“…Just as I thought.”
When I returned to the classroom, Kaede muttered.
Her gaze was fixed on Suzuna and Shindo at the back of the classroom, by the window.
“They’re just talking.”
I tried to sound calm.
“What if they’re making plans to meet up?”
“No way, Suzuna said she’s not interested in Shindo.”
“She’s just pretending.”
Kaede didn’t believe me at all.
“It’s none of my business.”
I sat down at my desk, feeling like I was about to explode.
“Then I guess I’ll eavesdrop.”
“H-Hey…”
Kaede approached Suzuna, pretending to be a passerby.
I’m not worried about Suzuna and Shindo.
I’m just focusing on Kaede’s strange behavior.
—Thud
Kaede, passing by, dropped her wallet, and Suzuna picked it up.
What is she doing?
Kaede, after receiving her wallet, immediately returned to me.
“Riri, you might be too late.”
“…Huh?”
◇◇◇
“So, Riri, why aren’t you going home?”
“Well, I’m about to.”
Kaede spoke to me as I remained in my seat after school.
Only Suzuna, Shindo, a few classmates, Kaede, and I were left in the classroom.
“You’re worried about Shindo, aren’t you?”
“Not really.”
But I did hear something strange from Kaede.
Apparently, Suzuna cornered Shindo after school and said,
“Do you have some time after school?”
Looking directly at him, she said,
“I need to talk to you.”
And then, she said something suggestive:
“It’s about… the future.”
“The other students have left. Those two won’t talk if we stay here, so we have to leave.”
“I didn’t know that, but I was thinking of going home soon.”
“…Sure.”
We went out into the hallway.
“So you’re going to eavesdrop?”
Kaede said knowingly.
“I’m not.”
“Just be honest.”
“I am being honest.”
I led Kaede towards the entrance.
“…”
But I still felt… uneasy.
I stopped, and Kaede looked at me.
“What’s wrong? Aren’t we going home?”
“I forgot something.”
“…That sounds like it’ll take a while. I’m going home.”
“Okay, see you later.”
“I hope you find what you forgot.”
Kaede waved and left.
I know she’s being considerate.
I returned to the classroom.
◇◇◇
I believe that Suzuna wouldn’t change her mind so easily.
But Kaede’s words made me worry.
I eavesdropped on the conversation coming from the classroom.
Sorry, I’ll leave as soon as I confirm…
“So… I want to be with the person I like… all the time, if possible.”
Eh…
Suzuna’s words made my breath catch in my throat.
“Amatsuki is also a girl, you know. What if she wants someone to comfort her broken heart?”
Kaede’s words from earlier replayed in my mind.
Suzuna… is she… interested in Shindo…?
“I see, I see… you’ve really changed, haven’t you? So that’s what it was.”
“Yeah, that’s it.”
“Okay, I understand.”
They looked at each other as if they had reached an understanding.
“We’re childhood friends, stuck together. I can tell when you’re serious, and I’m not insensitive enough to deny that.”
And then, as if prompted, they reached for each other’s hands.
No, I can’t let that happen…
“Thank you.”
Hearing Suzuna’s happy voice, I couldn’t take it anymore.
—Stumble!
I almost tripped, caught myself, and then ran.
I made an irreversible mistake.
I was arrogant, thinking Suzuna would only look at me.
I could only run away from the classroom, escaping from reality.
106 The Truth
I left the classroom.
I saw a figure disappearing around the corner of the hallway.
All I could see was her legs and the swirling of her skirt.
But I knew instantly that it was Riri-chan.
Why is she in such a hurry?
It was as if she was running away from me.
I started running after her.
◇◇◇
When I reached the entrance, Riri-chan was changing her shoes.
Thanks to that, I managed to catch up.
“Riri-chan?!”
“—!”
Riri-chan looked at me reflexively at my raised voice.
Her expression was a mixture of surprise, sadness, and anger.
It seemed to be filled with complicated emotions.
“Wait, I need to talk to you!”
“…”
But Riri-chan only glanced at me.
After changing into her outdoor shoes, she left the entrance without hesitation.
She didn’t say anything, just ran away from me.
“Hey, why…”
Am I being rejected again…?
Even if I catch her, she’ll probably just push me away like last time.
She might not want to listen to me anymore.
“But I haven’t… told you yet…”
But I won’t give up.
I’ll tell her everything, and if it doesn’t work out, then it can’t be helped.
I can’t end this without trying.
I’ll catch her and make her listen.
But Riri-chan is fast.
If I change my shoes, she’ll quickly outrun me.
So…
“Riri-chan, wait!”
So I chased after her in my indoor shoes.
“—?!”
She probably didn’t expect me to call out to her again so soon.
Riri-chan turned around abruptly and stared at me.
But she didn’t stop.
The distance that had almost closed between us quickly widened again.
Why?
She could at least listen to me.
As she left the school building, the distance between us increased even further.
Riri-chan’s footsteps were light and swift.
My legs felt heavy and clumsy, my lungs burning for oxygen.
My ragged breathing was loud and annoying.
I’ll never catch up at this rate.
I can’t do anything unless she stops.
—How can I make her turn around?
She can definitely hear me, she’s looking at me, and she knows why.
Knowing all that, she’s still choosing to ignore me.
That’s why she won’t stop.
How do you stop someone like that…?
“Riri…”
Maybe…
Maybe Riri-chan doesn’t like being forced to do things she doesn’t want to do
Then would she turn around if I granted her wish?
Would she be willing to at least listen to me?
If I accept what I’ve been stubbornly refusing…
Would she also… accept me, even a little?
With that hope, I forced oxygen into my burning lungs.
My heart pounded, but that didn’t matter now.
I clung to that sliver of hope, hoping she would listen.
I took a deep breath and shouted—
“—Riri!!”
It was just her name.
Just calling her without honorifics.
But it’s what she wanted, what I’ve been refusing to do.
I wanted to close the distance between us by closing that distance.
“…Why?”
My feelings reached her.
Her footsteps stopped.
I caught up to her and put my hand on her shoulder.
I was out of breath, my body exhausted.
But I finally caught up.
“—Why are you suddenly calling me by my name?”
“…That’s because…”
I caught my breath.
I straightened my bent knees and looked up.
I met her gaze, her eyes filled with suspicion.
I didn’t call her by her name just to get her attention.
It’s not just that I didn’t want to call her “Riri.”
I had my reasons.
And now, I thought I could face her by revealing those reasons.
That’s why I’m standing here.
“Riri, I…”
She once said,
“Let’s call each other by our first names.”
“Distance doesn’t shrink unless you take a step forward yourself.”
She’s always been trying to close the distance between us.
But no matter how many times she called me “Suzuna,” I insisted on calling her “Riri-chan.”
Because I thought that was the appropriate distance.
She probably thought it wasn’t equal.
But that’s not true.
Because… everything… hasn’t been real for me.
“My name… is Yukitsuki Mashiro.”
That’s why I wanted Riri to call me Mashiro.
Because that’s the real me.
Even though I’m Amatsuki Suzuna in this world, I want Riri, at least, to know the real Yukitsuki Mashiro.
Because only then can we truly be equals, calling each other by our names.
------------------ 
107 If My Feelings Reach You
“Yukitsuki… Mashiro…?”
Riri tilted her head, unable to comprehend.
That’s to be expected.
But I’ve decided to tell her.
“Yes. Winter ‘snow(yuki),’ the ‘moon(tsuki)’ in the night sky, and ‘pure white.’ Yukitsuki Mashiro.”
“N-No… you’re Suzuna, right…?”
“This body is.”
I placed my hand on my chest, looking down at Amatsuki Suzuna’s body.
“But… the inside, my heart… is someone else’s.”
“Um, well…”
“I’m completely different from Amatsuki Suzuna. I didn’t have any dreams, my parents didn’t care about me, and I was a gloomy, unremarkable girl. And I thought… there was no point in living anymore, so I… took my own…”
I don’t remember those memories very clearly.
Maybe I want to forget how messed up I was, or maybe the moments before death are just hazy.
But I do remember feeling like there was no meaning to my life.
“And when I woke up next, I was Amatsuki Suzuna. That’s me.”
“…W-Wait. Even if, hypothetically, that’s true, since when…?”
“Right before I met you, right before I saved that person who was being harassed by a man.”
“…H-Hmm.”
Riri was trying to understand, but it wasn’t sinking in.
That’s fine.
As long as she knows a little about me, that’s enough.
“And… this world… is the world of a dating sim. The protagonist is Shindo Minato, and the heroines are… you and me.”
“…A dating sim… Shindo is the protagonist…”
Riri’s eyes started to glaze over.
She’s not just confused; she probably thinks I’ve lost my mind.
But I’ll keep talking, at least to Riri.
“I know it sounds unbelievable.”
“…It does. Obviously.”
“But you told me not to lie, Riri.”
“I did, but…”
“I’ve been lying all this time, but I couldn’t tell you. I didn’t think you’d believe me, so I tried to hide it.”
But that became difficult.
My inconsistent actions were all seen through by Riri.
That dissonance accumulated within her, disrupting our relationship.
“Shindo-kun is the protagonist, and we’re the heroines. So there was a possibility that you’d fall for him.”
“No, I don’t think that would happen…”
A natural reaction.
But that’s fine.
It doesn’t matter if she believes that this is a dating sim world or that Shindo-kun is the protagonist.
The important thing is what I was thinking, why I was acting that way.
“So I wanted to shift the interest towards the other heroines: Kokona-chan, Kanaori Reika-san, and Futaba-senpai. That’s why I was always talking to them and Shindo-kun.”
And somewhere along the way, they started supporting me.
They changed me and became the catalyst for my actions.
“And my birthday in June is Yukitsuki Mashiro’s, and the one in August is Amatsuki Suzuna’s. I wasn’t lying to you. I like stuffed animals; that’s my hobby, not Amatsuki Suzuna’s.”
The misunderstanding arose because the person inside changed.
“So that’s why I was getting close to Shindo-kun. I didn’t want to ruin our relationship, Riri.”
This is the important part.
It doesn’t matter if she believes the outrageous story about this being a different world.
I just want her to understand how much I care about her, beyond all that.
“Th-Then… what about… earlier…?”
“Earlier?”
Riri, processing my words one by one, voiced her remaining question.
“You were with Shindo in the classroom. And you said, ‘I want to be with the person I like… all the time, if possible.’ And Shindo said, ‘Okay.’ …So I thought you two were… becoming a couple, and I…”
“Th-That’s not true! What are you talking about?!”
I was wondering why she ran away from me, but so that’s what she was thinking.
“I like you, Riri, so I decided to be with you, always. That’s why I told Shindo-kun that he didn’t have to celebrate Amatsuki Suzuna’s birthday with me.”
“I-I see…”
Riri nodded, though I don’t think she’s completely convinced.
“You already celebrated with me, and that’s enough. I don’t need anyone else.”
I think I finally managed to reveal what I’ve been hiding.
But Riri’s confusion was still evident.
I’m not going to deny it, and it’s understandable if she thinks I’m crazy.
But I’m just trying my best to convey what I want her to know.
“—Riri.”
I stepped closer to Riri and took her hands.
Even if she doesn’t believe me, I want her to know that these feelings are real.
“So, my first love isn’t Shindo-kun. That was Amatsuki Suzuna’s love, not mine.”
“So that means…”
Riri’s wavering eyes reflected my image.
I met her gaze directly, not looking away.
“My first love is you, Riri. You’re the first person I’ve ever liked, and I want to be with you always… please believe that.”
“…!”
Riri’s hands tightened around mine.
I was pulled closer to her chest, but her head was down, so I couldn’t tell what she was thinking.
“Seriously, this is crazy. Do you think I can believe that?”
“…No, I don’t.”
That’s why I’ve been hiding it.
“Normally, you’d think it’s a lie to cover up our fight.”
“I would.”
So maybe even after saying all this, nothing will change.
Maybe Riri’s feelings will drift even further away.
Knowing that, I still told her.
“…But it’s… too clumsy of a lie, isn’t it?”
“It is.”
Maybe I should have told a more convincing lie instead of the truth.
Revealing the truth isn’t always the right thing to do.
Maybe I should have told a gentle lie that would comfort Riri.
But I didn’t even want to do that. I couldn’t.
I wanted her to see the real me.
“Honestly, I can’t believe that kind of story. I’m thinking, ‘What is she even talking about?’”
“…I know.”
That’s normal.
It would be natural for our relationship to end here.
That’s sad, but there’s nothing I can do—
“…But I wonder why…”
“Riri?”
Riri’s hands, clasped in mine, were trembling.
“Even though I can’t believe it, even though I think it’s strange… why am I so happy…?”
“Riri…”
“If what you said is true… a part of me feels relieved. But more than that…”
Riri looked up, her eyes glistening with tears.
“You called me by my name for the first time, you said I’m your first love, you said you want to be with me always… That makes me so happy.”
A single tear rolled down Riri’s cheek.
“…I’m sorry. I couldn’t… tell you the truth until now.”
“I’m the one who should apologize… I wouldn’t even listen, I kept rejecting you…”
“No, don’t apologize. I’m the strange one…”
Maybe this is all just a convenient delusion for me.
So she doesn’t have to accept this fictional story.
“But these feelings are real, so please believe that.”
I took another step closer.
A step that closed the distance between Riri and me to zero.
I kissed her.
Riri’s tears, spilling from her eyes, traced a path down my cheek, our skin becoming wet together.
When our lips parted, Riri’s teary eyes gazed intently at me.
“Riri.”
“…Mashiro.”
And I kissed her again.
108 A Small Change
Today is the closing ceremony.
In the past, I would have spent this time without any particular feelings.
Or rather, if I were still Amatsuki Suzuna, separated from Riri, this would have been an agonizing time, even more painful than usual.
But I can face it now because—
“Mashiro.”
At our usual meeting spot in the downtown area, Riri called my name.
It feels strangely nostalgic, even though it was just a few days ago that we stopped walking to school together.
The return to our daily routine, with one small change, made my heart race.
“It feels… strange to be called that again.”
“What does?”
“My name. I haven’t been called that in a while.”
Riri started calling me by my name.
It’s a borrowed name in this world, but she’s the only one who calls me by my real name.
It’s embarrassing, but also… joyful.
“Mashiro is your real name, right?”
“Yes, if you believe me, Riri.”
“Well… honestly, it still doesn’t feel real, but…”
Riri, smiling wryly, is an honest person.
She probably still doesn’t believe that this world is a dating sim.
“But I also… know that you’re not lying, Mashiro. It’s a strange feeling.”
But she’s at least trying to believe me, even a little.
And that’s enough.
Whether this is a different world or not isn’t that important to us.
What matters more right now is…
“Riri, aren’t you wearing the necklace? And your skirt is also… back to normal.”
The buttons of her blouse were undone as usual, and her skirt was short.
Riri let out a small groan at my words, but she quickly regained her composure.
“I thought about it, but I don’t want the necklace you gave me to be confiscated at school. And buttoning up my blouse and lengthening my skirt isn’t… functional in this heat.”
I also don’t want the necklace to be confiscated, so that’s fine.
But I want to say something about the blouse and skirt.
“Didn’t you say you don’t use the word ‘functional’ for clothes?”
Those were her words when I talked about the functionality of my sweatsuit.
“I don’t, but you did, Mashiro.”
I see, she thought I’d be convinced if she used my own words against me.
But I’m also happy that she remembers such small details.
I realized that this is how relationships deepen as time passes.
“Well, it’s fine.”
“Eh, seriously?”
Riri’s surprised voice.
It’s strange, but I feel like I’m more tolerant of Riri than I used to be.
It’s probably because I’m more confident in our relationship, knowing that she understands me and still wants to be with me.
“It’s more… you, after all.”
“Ehehe…? Right? I knew it.”
Our relationship, unchanged even after I revealed everything, is filling the loneliness within me.
“Let’s go.”
“I’m tired, but it’ll be over soon, so I guess I’ll endure it.”
A languid, hot summer.
But I can face it with a smile as long as I’m with Riri.
◇◇◇
The closing ceremony was a formal affair, time passing by without anything particularly noteworthy happening.
I did listen to Kanaori Reika’s speech on the stage, but the rest was a blur.
It ended before I knew it, and the students started leaving the gymnasium.
I followed the flow of the crowd.
As I walked down the hallway, the summer sun suddenly shone through the windows.
I squinted, and then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
“Eh…?”
I turned around, and there were swaying twintails.
“Amatsuki Suzuna, I need to talk to you.”
“Kokona-chan? What is it?”
“It’s too crowded here, so let’s go somewhere else. I won’t take up too much of your time.”
There’s still some time before the teacher comes to the classroom.
And we only have homeroom left.
It shouldn’t be a problem.
I followed Kokona-chan and left the crowded hallway.
◇◇◇
We arrived at the courtyard.
It’s been a while, and the plants had grown lush and green, the trees covered in vibrant leaves.
“So, you finally broke up with Onii-chan.”
Kokona-chan got straight to the point.
Shindo-kun must have told her.
“It wasn’t a ‘breakup.’ We weren’t even dating in the first place.”
“But you were more than friends. You’ve been taking care of Onii-chan all this time, since we were little.”
“Well, that might be true… but I stopped that in the spring.”
It was an unexpected consequence that Kokona-chan’s attitude towards Shindo-kun changed because of that.
“I know that, but you didn’t tell him clearly, did you?”
“That’s true, I didn’t.”
I realized that my half-hearted attitude was the cause of everything, so I clarified my stance.
I couldn’t face Riri otherwise.
“Onii-chan liked you, you know. He was treating you like… more than a friend, less than a lover, because of your long-standing relationship, but he was a bit… conflicted when he heard you had someone you liked.”
“I… see.”
I didn’t sense that at all, but I guess those feelings were there somewhere.
“He didn’t even realize it himself. He finally understood that having someone by his side isn’t something to be taken for granted, after you left.”
“But that’s the same for you, Kokona-chan, isn’t it?”
Kokona-chan’s character was always competing with Amatsuki Suzuna, diligently taking care of her brother.
Since her attitude changed around spring, she must have felt a sense of loss then too.
“Well… that’s true. But Kokona is his little sister, so our relationship will continue. For better or worse, that’s what family is.”
“I see…”
“But I think it’s a good thing in the end. I feel like it’s finally a chance for Onii-chan, who always relies on others, to become more independent.”
“I see, then maybe it’s a good thing.”
There are people who will offer you a helping hand, but there will always be a time when you have to stand on your own two feet.
Otherwise, the relationship will eventually become distorted.
That’s my experience.
“So, are things going well with Hinase Riri?”
“…?!”
How does she know that?
I haven’t told Shindo-kun.
Kanaori-san and Futaba-senpai know, but they’re not the type to gossip…
Could it be that everyone at school already knows…?
“I can tell just by looking at you. Kokona has also known you almost as long as Onii-chan.”
“Ah, I see… that’s true.”
“Well, it’s fine, isn’t it? You, who have been clinging to Onii-chan since we were little, have finally found someone new. That’s healthier.”
“Well, yeah… thanks to her.”
I don’t know what to say anymore.
“At first, I wondered why you were with such a gal, but seeing how much you’ve changed, maybe I was prejudiced.”
“…Have I really changed…?”
“You have, haven’t you? I don’t know if it’s for better or worse, but…”
“There’s a ‘worse’ scenario?”
“Well, you’re not as… gentle and agreeable as before. You’ve become more assertive.”
“That’s… not a good change…”
I think there’s a difference because I’m not Amatsuki Suzuna.
But even so, it’s not a positive change.
“But those are trivial things. You don’t have to worry about them.”
“I wonder…”
That makes me even more worried.
“You are. You’re much happier now than before.”
“…Eh?”
It’s embarrassing that it’s so obvious.
“Th-That’s not true!”
“Don’t get so flustered, it’s tiring to watch.”
I’m sorry…
I wonder how many times Kokona-chan sighed while waiting for me to calm down.
“So it’s fine. The important thing is whether you’re happy or not.”
Kokona-chan stretched, raising both hands.
As if to say she had said everything she wanted to say, she turned around and left the courtyard.
“Kokona also needs to learn a little from you.”
I wasn’t sure what she meant by that, but we parted ways.
The sun was scorching, so I returned to the classroom.
Summer break was just around the corner.
------------------ 
109 Summer Break Plans
Summer break, the long-awaited holiday for all students.
Every student looks forward to this extended break; no one dreads it.
For me, it’s usually just a nice break from the mental anguish of being alone at school.
But this summer break is special for me because—
“Hey, Mashiro, this kind of summer break is unacceptable.”
“…”
Apparently, summer break isn’t so special for the girl who made it special for me.
That’s disappointing.
“Hey, I’m talking to you, don’t ignore me.”
“…Well, I don’t really understand what you’re saying.”
Riri says this summer break, which I find special, is unacceptable.
I can’t immediately understand such a contrasting viewpoint.
“You understand, don’t you? Staying at home every single day is a bit much.”
“…It’s only been a week.”
“A whole week! A whole week of just going back and forth between our houses! What kind of summer break is that?!”
Riri started complaining loudly.
I could only sigh at her outburst.
“Even so, Riri, you’re going to summer cram school, so you’re mostly at the tutoring center.”
She, seriously considering university entrance exams, finally started going to cram school, realizing she was falling behind.
Because of that, she’s only free in the mornings or evenings, so we haven’t been able to spend much time together.
We might have actually spent more time together at school.
“That’s why I invited you to come with me! But you refused!”
“…Well, I don’t need it.”
My grades are currently better than Riri’s.
Since I’m planning to apply to the same university as her, I don’t need to make any extra effort if I can maintain my current level.
So I’m spending my days waiting for her to come home.
“And even though you’re not coming with me, you order me to send you a picture every day before I leave!”
“Well, that’s only natural.”
“Why is it natural?!”
Even though I’ve matured a bit, Riri is still an attractive girl.
I don’t know when or who might try to hit on her.
So I asked her to refrain from wearing revealing clothes and to send me a picture before leaving the house, just to confirm. It’s become a rule for our summer break.
The obedient Riri has been diligently following it.
“I’m worried about you, Riri.”
“W-Well, that’s hard to argue with… but wearing denim pants in this heat is torture!”
Riri’s casual clothes are incredibly glamorous, unlike her school uniform.
If she wears revealing clothes on top of that, everyone will be staring at her instead of paying attention in class.
I can’t allow that.
“It’s fine, it suits you, you have a nice figure.”
“D-Don’t try to trick me with that…”
She’s acting flustered, even as she says that.
“Come on, you’ve been working so hard. You should rest after studying.”
Today, we were at my house, and it was evening.
I was lying on the bed, and Riri was reviewing her studies at the low table.
I don’t think it’s good to burden her any further.
“I have free time in the afternoon too! But you don’t want to go anywhere, Mashiro!”
“…It’s hot outside.”
It’s crazy to go outside in this scorching heat.
“And tomorrow is a holiday, so we can go anywhere.”
“…Mountains and beaches are out of the question.”
“So we’re not going anywhere!”
“I told you before, I can’t handle those cheerful places.”
Nature is too overwhelming for a gloomy person like me.
“Then at least let me sleep over! I don’t want to go home every night!”
“Eh… because…”
It’s true that we could spend a lot of time together if we slept over.
But that would naturally lead to… that…
I hugged the penguins, creating a barrier between Riri and me.
“Hey, don’t try to act cute.”
“That’s not what I’m doing, I’m protecting myself.”
“That’s what I mean.”
“…?”
Anyway, I don’t think it’s time yet.
I think there should be a more… definite time and place.
I don’t think it’s good to do it casually.
“Okay, then how about a festival?”
“…Ugh.”
She hit the nail on the head again.
It’s not mountains or the beach, it’s a local event with a low barrier to entry.
“Okay, it’s settled.”
“…Fine.”
“Don’t complain anymore. I’m holding back too, you know.”
That’s true.
I know this is a good compromise.
The festival is apparently being held on the main street in the downtown area.
“Then let’s meet at my place in an hour.”
“Eh, today?!”
“The festival started yesterday.”
That’s not what I meant…
Her energy, deciding and acting instantly, is amazing…
“…You’re so decisive.”
“Of course! Tomorrow is a holiday, so we have to enjoy today!”
Riri-chan beamed and then packed up her study materials to go home and get ready.
◇◇◇
“…Oh.”
I let out a gasp when I arrived at Riri-chan’s house.
“So? How do I look?”
Riri was wearing a yukata.
Her loosely curled hair was tied up, and her yukata was a deep indigo with a white floral pattern.
I was captivated by her appearance.
“…Beautiful.”
“Ah, wait, that serious tone is making me blush.”
“I’m serious.”
“Ah… thank you.”
Riri-chan’s eyes darted around, but her lips curved into a smile.
She seemed happy.
“Okay, then let’s go.”
Just as she was about to head for the entrance, she took my hand.
I understood her silent message: “Wait.”
“…Hmm?”
“I have… another yukata.”
Now that she mentioned it, I saw a reddish-purple yukata with a white floral pattern in the corner of my eye.
“…You like yukatas, Riri-chan?”
“It’s a festival date, so the outfit is important. Don’t you understand?”
“Ah, okay…”
I was wearing a simple outfit: a khaki linen long skirt and a white T-shirt.
“You should wear a yukata too, Mashiro.”
“…Um, I don’t know how to put one on.”
“It’s fine, I’ll help you. Okay?”
Riri-chan’s gaze was serious, and she wasn’t giving me a chance to refuse.
“…Please.”
110 Two at the Summer Festival
“Oh…”
Riri helped me put on the yukata and then urged me to look in the full-length mirror.
There stood a black-haired girl in a yukata.
“So? How is it? Isn’t it great?”
Riri puffed out her chest, seemingly proud of herself.
Apparently, she wants to hear my opinion on how I look in a yukata.
“…It feels… strange.”
“Why? It’s cute.”
…Well, the yukata is cute, but…
I’m not sure if I’m cute.
“Clothes make the man… or something like that?”
“Ugh, that’s your usual cynical remark, isn’t it?”
“Yep, you got it.”
Riri’s understanding of me is improving.
“You should deny it.”
“It’s true.”
“Seriously…”
Riri cupped my cheeks in her hands.
My face was sandwiched between her palms, and my lips felt like they were sticking out.
“…Mmph.”
I couldn’t speak properly.
“I keep telling you you’re cute, Mashiro, so be more confident.”
“Mmph… mph…”
“Eh? What?”
“…”
It’s not fair; she’s the one who’s making it difficult for me to speak.
I brushed her hands away.
“…You’re talking about Amatsuki Suzuna.”
So it’s not about me after all.
“Seriously, you don’t understand, Mashiro.”
“Understand what?”
Riri sighed like an old man.
“You were already Mashiro when we met, right?”
“That’s… true, but…”
“Then it doesn’t matter! You’ve become cuter and cuter since we met. That means you are cute, Mashiro.”
“…I see.”
I was at a loss for words after her passionate speech.
At least, if that’s the truth for Riri, there’s no need for me to deny it.
No matter what other people think, if Riri thinks I’m cute, then maybe that’s enough.
“Riri, you’re overwhelmingly cuter. You’ve raised the bar for ‘cute’ too high.”
So I told her my truth.
I’m not confident in my own appearance, but I think the word “cute” applies to Riri.
I can’t use a word that suits her so well to describe myself.
“D-Don’t suddenly compliment me…”
“I wasn’t complimenting you.”
“Eh?”
“I was just saying what I think.”
“Ah… seriously…”
Riri took my hand.
Her hand was warmer than usual.
“Come on, let’s go. It’s a waste to wear a yukata inside.”
“…You’re right.”
◇◇◇
The summer festival.
The night was illuminated by the lights of the stalls and street lamps.
Riri and I walked through the crowds.
“…This is hard to walk in.”
I couldn’t get used to the clatter of the geta.
“Hmm? Is this your first time wearing geta?”
These traditional Japanese footwear Riri lent me seem to be difficult for me.
“It is. And I’ve never worn a yukata before either.”
Compared to my clumsy gait, Riri walked gracefully and smoothly ahead of me.
I thought she looked beautiful, turning around against the backdrop of the brightly lit stalls.
“Ehehe, I’m taking all of Mashiro’s firsts.”
Riri smiled happily, saying something trivial.
“You seem used to this, Riri.”
She can even dress someone in a yukata, so she must have been to festivals many times before.
“But this is also my first time.”
“…No way.”
That’s a bit of a stretch.
“It’s my first time at a festival with my girlfriend.”
“…”
That caught me off guard.
I didn’t expect her to say that.
“Ehehe, hey, hey, what do you want to do, Mashiro?”
Riri put her arm around me and looked at the stalls.
She was smiling more than usual, I don’t know what she finds so amusing.
“Anything is fine.”
“Ah, then how about target practice?”
Riri pointed at a nearby stall.
There were prizes lined up on shelves and toy guns on the counter.
“Have you done this before?”
“No.”
“Then try it.”
Riri excitedly led me to the target practice stall.
She didn’t wait for my reply, just pulled me along.
I reluctantly picked up a gun.
The shelves were filled with various prizes, from game consoles and toys to snacks.
There were prizes of all sizes, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to knock down the big ones.
I decided to aim for a small box of candy.
—Bang
The cork hit the candy box, but it didn’t budge.
“…What is this?”
“Too bad, Mashiro.”
Riri, who had been excited until now, was laughing behind me.
Annoyed, I hit the target a few more times.
But the candy box remained standing.
“Mashiro, you’re terrible at this.”
“…Shut up.”
This might be a simple game for Riri, who’s used to festivals.
But it’s my first time, and I think I’m doing pretty well just hitting the target a few times.
“If you’re that good, then you try, Riri.”
“Eh? Really? Can I?”
Saying that, Riri rolled up her sleeves and took aim.
—Bang
“…Huh?”
“Oh dear.”
The cork missed all the targets and landed on the ground.
—Bang, bang, bang
Same thing.
In the end, we both got nothing.
“Ahahaha, I can’t hit it!”
Riri laughed at her own failure, clutching her stomach.
“You were making fun of me just now?”
I was doing much better than her.
I couldn’t believe her attitude.
“I never said I was good at it.”
“Even so, I was better than you.”
“It’s the same if we didn’t knock anything down.”
“…That’s not a fair conclusion.”
“We’re both bad at this, so we’re a good match.”
Riri cheerfully took my hand and pulled me along.
It’s so unreasonable and forceful, but…
Well, it’s a festival, so it’s fine.
“What do you want to do next?”
“Anything you want.”
Nothing particularly unusual happened after that.
We drew lots, winning nothing of value.
We bought and wore masks that we’d only use today.
We ate candied apples that were too sweet and cotton candy that made our mouths sticky.
A series of trivial events, nothing special.
And yet, it felt so… magical, because Riri was by my side.
“Mashiro, are you having fun?”
Such a simple question.
“Yeah, I’m having fun.”
I’m enjoying these days with Riri so much that I can answer without hesitation.
◇◇◇
“Ah, I’m tired.”
Our legs weary from walking, we sat down next to each other on a bench in a quiet park away from the crowds.
We relaxed, enjoying the peace and quiet.
“It’s hot even at night, it’s crowded, and I’m not used to walking so much.”
“That’s what makes it fun.”
A few hours ago, I would have disagreed completely.
But now, I’m feeling a little more agreeable.
“Maybe.”
“Oh, you finally admit it?”
“Only when I’m with you, Riri.”
“…Fufu.”
Riri’s eyes crinkled at my reply.
“I want to… do this…”
Her previously cheerful voice now had a hint of seriousness.
“Hmm?”
“I want to keep doing this, next year, the year after that, always.”
Riri often emphasizes being together forever.
I understand why she felt that way before we started dating, but is there a reason to be insecure even now that we are?
“Are you thinking that I might disappear someday because I’m not from this world?”
“…No, it’s just… my family is all… scattered, so I sometimes wonder if you’ll also disappear someday, Mashiro.”
Riri’s profile, her gaze fixed on the empty space before her, her eyes looked emptier than ever.
I don’t want her to have such a sad expression when I’m here with her.
I put my hand on top of hers.
“Riri, I’ll always be with you.”
“…Really?”
Riri’s eyes lit up with emotion.
“Yeah, forever.”
And I kissed her.
I wanted to convey my feelings, even a little, to make her feel that I’m here with her.
Light flickered in the dimly lit park.
Colorful fireworks bloomed in the night sky.
“…I want… more concrete proof.”
Riri’s eyes wavered.
I’m probably the only one in this world who can quell that uncertainty.
“Sleep over at my place tonight.”
The sound of fireworks continued to echo through the night.
A brief silence made me wonder if my voice had been drowned out by the noise.
“Okay.”
But Riri’s reply reassured me.
------------------ 
Final: Always Together
…I’m so restless.
I lay in bed in my room, hugging the penguins, staring blankly at the ceiling.
The reason for my restlessness is simple—
“Mashiro, thanks for letting me use the bath.”
The door opened, and Riri, fresh from the bath, entered the room.
“Ah, you’re welcome.”
I jumped out of bed.
We came straight to my house from the festival.
I took a bath first, and then Riri used it after me.
“Are the pajamas okay? Do they fit?”
“Yeah, they’re perfect.”
Naturally, I lent Riri my pajamas since she didn’t have any clothes here.
The lavender short-sleeved top and shorts looked glamorous on her.
“That’s surprising, Mashiro. You wear this kind of thing?”
“No, I’ve never worn them…”
They’re probably Amatsuki Suzuna’s, I wouldn’t have the courage to wear them.
I’m wearing navy blue long-sleeved pajamas and long pants.
“Eh, that’s a waste. They’re cute.”
“I can’t… show that much skin.”
“Even in pajamas?”
“It’s… drafty, and I’m not used to it.”
—Creak
The bed creaked.
Riri sat down next to me.
“What do you mean, making me wear these pajamas that you’re too embarrassed to wear yourself?”
Riri covered her mouth with her hand, grinning mischievously.
I can pretty much guess what she wants me to say.
“What do you think it means?”
But I didn’t want to fall for her trap, so I returned the question.
“You’re turned on, aren’t you?”
Riri said playfully, trying to keep it light.
Her ability to handle any situation, keeping the conversation going, is typical of her excellent communication skills.
But her words hit a nerve.
Riri’s flushed skin looked alluring.
And that body was exposed in my space.
Next to me on the bed, wearing my pajamas, with an unguarded smile.
It’s impossible for me not to feel something.
“What if I said yes?”
Unlike Riri, I can’t speak playfully.
I’m an extreme person: I hate it if I hate it, and I like it if I like it.
So I say what I think.
My straightforward words made Riri’s smile falter.
“Well… what do you mean, ‘what if’…? That puts me in a difficult position.”
Even though I’m the only one here, Riri-chan scratched her cheek and looked away.
“What do you want me to do?”
“Y-You’re making me say it…? There’s such a thing as… reading the room, going with the flow…?”
I’m not good at grasping vague things like “the mood” or “the flow.”
I need more… clarity.
“You want me to hold you, don’t you?”
“…Y-Yeah. You’re being very direct.”
“Riri, you made me say it when it was my turn.”
“Ah… that’s true, but… it’s so embarrassing to be on the receiving end…”
She’s the one who told me that I have to verbalize things.
And now she’s acting like I shouldn’t.
Reading the room is truly difficult.
“Do you not want me to? I won’t if you don’t.”
“…Of course I want you to.”
I put the penguins I was holding onto the floor.
I don’t need a barrier between us right now. I want them to… look away for a bit.
“Really?”
“…Please.”
I gently touched Riri’s shoulder.
Her skin was warm, fresh from the bath.
Or maybe it wasn’t just because of the bath.
I kissed her, a deep kiss.
Our tongues intertwined as we sought each other, devouring each other’s mouths.
When our lips parted, Riri’s eyes were moist and dreamy.
Her expression was so alluring that I felt myself being consumed by her.
I gently pushed her shoulders and laid her down on the bed.
Her smooth hair spread across the bed, and a sweet fragrance wafted through the air.
The feeling of dominance, looking down at Riri-chan silently, heightened my excitement.
“I’m going to undress you.”
I reached for the buttons of her pajamas.
“…The lights?”
“I won’t be able to see if I turn them off.”
“No, it’s… too bright. Turn them off.”
I’m already inexperienced, and I won’t be able to do this properly if I can’t even see.
“Rejected.”
“…Seriously?”
I undressed Riri without hesitation.
Riri, completely naked, was beautiful.
“Hey, you’re staring too much.”
“You did the same to me.”
“But the lights weren’t this bright.”
Riri-chan’s blushing, embarrassed expression was cute.
I touched her breast.
I could feel her arousal from the way her body twitched slightly.
Her breasts were too large for my hands.
I touched her as gently as possible.
Her breathing gradually quickened.
“…How is it?”
“Don’t… stare at me… It’s too much…”
“I have to look.”
“You’re doing this on purpose! You know what you’re doing!”
Apparently, it’s not bad.
After a while, Riri’s legs closed tightly.
Sensing that, I moved down from her chest to between her legs.
“Eh, ah, wait…”
I touched her Secret Place; she was wet.
I ran my tongue along her skin.
“…Haa…”
Her breathing intensified, her chest rising and falling rapidly.
Her body, fresh from the bath, was becoming increasingly sweaty.
I touched her with my lips and tongue.
As if to drink every drop of her moisture.
“Mashiro, that’s… dangerous…”
Riri-chan’s hand touched my head, her legs closed tightly around my face.
But I knew that it wasn’t rejection, but pleasure.
“Seriously…”
“It’s fine.”
“—!”
As if triggered by my words, Riri-chan’s body convulsed.
Her muscles tensed, and her back arched on the bed.
Listening to her moans, I waited for her body to relax.
◇◇◇
“How was it?”
I looked down at Riri-chan’s face, her breathing ragged, her body sprawled on the bed.
Riri-chan’s eyes met mine, and I noticed that her gaze was filled with a different emotion than before.
“…Mashiro, you seem… unfazed.”
“Well, I managed.”
“Want to hear my opinion?”
“I do.”
I waited, wanting to see her embarrassed expression, and Riri-chan grabbed my arms.
“Eh?”
She flipped me over, and now I was lying on the bed, and she was straddling me.
“Okay, I’ll tell you.”
“Um…”
I suddenly had a bad feeling.
“With my body.”
“I wasn’t… thinking about that today—”
Ignoring my hesitation, Riri-chan’s hand reached for the buttons of my pajamas.
“No questions asked.”
Now it was my turn to be undressed.
◇◇◇
How long did it last?
Before I knew it, we were holding each other.
My body was exhausted, but my mind was still clear.
I felt a blissful sense of happiness, our bodies warming each other.
“Hey, Mashiro.”
“What is it, Riri?”
We gazed into each other’s eyes and called each other’s names.
“Mashiro, you were originally… from outside the game world, right?”
Riri suddenly brought up that topic.
“…If you believe me, then yes.”
“Whether I believe it or not is a different matter.”
But it still seems to be an ambiguous boundary for her.
“Anyway, the protagonist is Shindo, right?”
“Yes, and we’re the heroines.”
“And you were trying to prevent Shindo and us, the heroines, from falling for each other, right?”
“Well, roughly speaking, yes.”
“I was thinking… isn’t that strange?”
“…What is?”
“Shindo is the protagonist, but he didn’t end up with anyone. And we, the heroines, are dating each other. Isn’t that weird?”
That’s true.
But I thought it was a bug caused by my irregular existence, Yukitsuki Mashiro.
“So you’re saying you want to deny that this is a dating sim world?”
I can’t argue with that.
“No, that’s not what I mean. I think the premise is wrong.”
“Wrong?”
“Yeah, in games… not just the characters, but the players are also the protagonists, aren’t they?”
Riri looked directly at me.
“So you, Mashiro, are the protagonist who was playing the game. It’s only natural that I fell for you.”
“…I see.”
That might be a valid interpretation.
A hypothesis.
“So, Mashiro, you chose me, the heroine, of your own free will.”
“That’s… true.”
We embraced, our foreheads touching gently.
The distance between us was close to zero.
“Then love me until the very end. My protagonist.”
The answer to that question is obvious.
“I will. My heroine.”
It’s a ridiculous story, whether it’s true or not.
But no matter what our relationship is, I think we would have ended up together in the end.
I feel that strongly, our happiness intertwined.
Side Story 
“Hey, Mashiro, um… don’t you ever change your… loungewear?”
“…Eh?”
Riri suddenly asked that, and I was taken aback.
Since we started dating, we’ve been spending a lot of time at each other’s houses.
We see each other almost every day, so it’s tiring to always go out, and we naturally settled into this routine.
Today, we were at my place. I was reading manga on the bed, and Riri was lying on her stomach on the carpet, reading a magazine.
I was a bit bewildered by her sudden question about my clothes.
“There’s no problem with this, is there?”
“There’s no problem… but a black sweatsuit? Really? As a girl?”
Yes, I wear a sweatsuit at home.
She was a little surprised when I wore this to go out with her before.
Since then, I’ve only been wearing it at home.
“No, it’s fine! You’re free to wear whatever you want at home. I know that. But, Mashiro, even though this is your room, I’m also here, right? Do you understand what that means?”
“…I have a guest.”
“You have your girlfriend over!”
She corrected me emphatically.
Well, I know that, but there are some words that are embarrassing to say out loud.
“In other words, it’s a date! This is a date! A home date is still a proper date!”
She repeated the word “date” in that short sentence.
I don’t want her to say that; it makes me self-conscious.
“That’s my point! What’s with the black sweatsuit on a date? No, it’s fine! It’s totally fine to wear it sometimes! But every single time, every single time I come to your house… every single time!… you’re wearing that! I can’t help but have some thoughts about it, can I?!”
Riri, seemingly having reached her limit, stood up.
She was apparently very dissatisfied with my outfit.
Riri always changes her clothes whenever we go out.
Today, she was wearing a college logo (I think) sweatshirt tucked into a long denim skirt.
…Wait, a sweatshirt?
“You’re wearing a sweatshirt too, Riri.”
So it’s the same as me?
“That’s different! I’m not saying sweatshirts are bad, it’s about how you wear them!”
…I don’t understand.
Why is it different when it’s the same sweatshirt?
I think she’s the one saying something strange, but… if that’s what she says, then that’s how it is.
“Well… I’m not… fashionable like you, Riri.”
“There’s a limit! Seriously! And… this… it’s pilling!”
Riri’s eyes widened in disbelief.
“It’s proof that it’s become a part of me.”
This sweatsuit is a perfect match for my body after wearing it so much.
See, it stretches comfortably with my movements.
No stress.
“That’s unacceptable! It’s not okay for a girl to wear a pilling sweatsuit!”
“I’m a human before I’m a girl.”
“That sounds deep, but it’s not relevant right now. Or rather, we’re girls before we’re humans.”
That’s the first time I’ve heard that.
Apparently, gender comes before species for us.
…Is that a philosophical statement?
“No, seriously, think about it. I’m not trying to force my fashion sense on you. I just want the cute Mashiro to become even cuter.”
“…Um…”
Riri can say these things with a straight face.
She’s always been like this, but it feels like it’s escalated since we started dating.
I don’t dislike it, but I don’t know how to react.
“Think about it the other way around. What if I was always wearing a black sweatsuit every time you came to my house?”
“…”
I imagined it.
Riri, covered from head to toe in a black sweatsuit.
But I could also picture her with perfect hair, makeup, and nails, and even the sweatsuit would be stylishly coordinated with carefully chosen innerwear and accessories.
Even the worn-out look would probably become fashionable in her hands.
“Well, a beautiful person looks beautiful no matter what.”
“…H-Hey…”
The atmosphere became awkward.
We were complimenting each other, calling each other cute and beautiful, and blushing.
We’re like a lovesick couple…
“I-I’m happy you think so, but that’s a separate issue from your outfit, Mashiro.”
“Well, I wasn’t trying to change the subject…”
“Anyway, don’t you have any… loungewear you want to wear?”
“If I did, I wouldn’t be wearing the same thing every time…”
I want Riri to understand the fundamental difference.
“So you’re saying I can choose everything for you? But you’ll complain, won’t you?”
“I won’t.”
“Eh, you won’t?”
“No, I’ll wear whatever you choose, Riri.”
“…Seriously?”
I’m not lying.
“I told you before, didn’t I? If you say it suits me, Riri, I’ll like it.”
“Y-You did, but… I didn’t think I could actually… choose your clothes…”
“It’s fine. You’re the only one who sees me anyway, Riri. As long as you like how I look, that’s all that matters.”
I don’t feel the need to be cute or fashionable.
But if that’s what Riri wants, I’ll do it for her.
If it makes her happy, that alone is enough for me.
“Th-That… response… is the most dangerous…”
Riri, for some reason, raised her voice and then smiled, her hands on her cheeks.
I don’t understand why she seems so satisfied when I haven’t even changed yet.
<The End>
