Chapter 39 – A shock on the eve of my birthday partyI have turned eight.
The birthday party is scheduled to be held in a week.
Also, the dollhouse sporting the scenery for the Sages of the Round Table nuis to use has been completed.
As it’s of their size, it’s not really that big, but a little caricaturized world of the Sages has finally taken shape, where the five of them can be seated at the table, read books, drink from a cup or two, and have other decorations.
Lisa, to whom I showed the thing first, was quite raptured.
With that said, for the next person to be delighted, I planned to call that prince Dotteal, with his rotten interests, but again, before the break of dawn, I was rudely awakened, polished up, dressed in a fancy dress, and thrown out into the entrance hall once again.
It’s that thing again; the prince will be coming. It seems I don’t need to bother calling him here after all.
But compared to before, my current clothes are quite plain.
They are a little different from the ones I was spiritedly dressed up in when greeting the royal family the other day.
While I stood absentmindedly in the entrance hall, Mother came up to me with a somber expression.
“Miranda, what did you do this time?”
“What are you implying by that, Mother?”
“His Highness Dotteal sent the letter about his coming to visit just yesterday. Yesterday! You hear me?! Usually, we are given a month to prepare in advance. When I wondered what could be the matter, I could not think of anything other than that it was somehow your fault.”
But I did nothing, I swear. And hey, Mother, do you think of me as a troublemaker?
I cannot comprehend this, truly.
After some waiting, the report of the prince’s coming came, along with the word that he wanted to talk with me privately.
Are the maids allowed to be present?
Although we’re both underage, having a boy and a girl stay alone in a closed room isn’t good for their reputations…
While I agonized over this, the prince arrived.
Since it came to this, I had only one option: bring him to my room with Lisa.
“I am sorry for suddenly coming to visit.”
You can say that again.
“Miss Miranda, I see it on your face that you’re troubled by this.”
“Wh, whatever do you mean? Hohoho.”
Was my archaic smile impression really that unnatural?
I was sure I could deceive anyone with my acting, though. Is it obvious to the prince?
I rubbed both cheeks. Not to inject myself with some mysterious power, nope.
Ah, he’s laughing. Damn it all.
“What business do you have with me today?”
Upon coming to my room and having a cup of tea, I cut straight to the chase.
“It’s a matter I’d not want others to hear about, if possible.”
“So my maid should not be present, then?”
“Probably it would be better for you too, Miss Miranda.”
“What do you mean by this?”
“I believe you are familiar with the word Nihon?”
Hah? Eh??? What did you say?
“Yes, I’m now convinced, judging by your reaction. When I heard that you were the founder of the Goth Loli Shop, I had people investigate it thoroughly.”
W, whaaat?! Since when did you have such a thing in mind?!
No, wait. Why does the prince know about Japan?
“Your Highness, could it be that you are…”
“That would be the case. So, can we talk with just two of us?”
“Yes… I do not mind.”
“That said, being together alone in here would be ill-advised; as such, maybe we could borrow an arbor in your garden?”
“That would be perfect…”
Aren’t I showing all my current emotions on my face right now?
Could it be that the prince is a reincarnator, too?
I feel like he’s hiding a lot more things.
Anyway, since we both didn’t want to stay in a closed room alone, we relocated to the arbor in the garden of my home.
What more is awaiting me during the talk there?
------------------ 
Chapter 40 – I learn of the prince’s secret“Now then, where should I start?”
We’re now sitting in the arbor together.
Lisa is staying a little away from us, where she can’t hear what we talk about, observing us.
She’ll probably come if I call her, though.
“Frankly, I don’t see the point of hiding it anymore, so, to tell the truth, I’m a reincarnator, that’s for sure.”
I’m desperate, so to hell with the noble lady’s speech.
“I thought as much. Since I am also one such person.”
Hm? Isn’t his speech kind of weird?
“Prince, do you remember your previous name? I don’t remember mine.”
“It is the same for me. Also, my sex got reversed after being reborn.”
“Whoah. Yours too, eh?”
For real? The prince’s heart is that of a pure maiden?
The prince’s face says that he thought as much about me.
“So my suspicions were correct. Miss Miranda, despite your girlish interests, you behave like a man, hohoho.”
“Prince, that laugh is unbecoming of you.”
“You can also drop the mask already.”
“For real? Well, for an old guy like me, it’s better to.”
“And I was an old lady… No, maybe I can still pass as a young lady?”
“”Ahahahaha!””
It seems like we both died in our thirties.
I left my girlfriend behind after my death, and the prince, too, died as if chasing after her boyfriend who had passed away.
Hm?
“You know, talking with you, Miranda, reminds me of that person whom I dated in my past life… Though I can’t exactly remember his disposition. The face, too, I already forgot.”
“Despite not remembering the face or the name, you can still pick up some by feeling.”
“We often drank at a bar in Ikebukuro while talking about otaku stuff.”
“Ah, I did similar things.”
“The place we also frequented was a semi-basement wine shop.”
“Yeah, we did have silly talks about yuri and BL. For when I started dating with her, I had started being corrupted by then.”
“I have been like that from the start, though.”
For a while, we sat in silence.
“Is it possible that we were dating before, Miranda?”
“Is it possible that we were dating before, prince?”
The silence fell upon us again.
A former old man who has now become a perfect beauty.
A former old lady who has now become a handsome guy.
After comparing our memories of big events and dating places, we concluded that, considering the timeline being the same, we were a couple from our previous lives.
What’s this? Did we both die right before our future marriage?
True, if I go by those haphazard feelings after talking everything out, I do get an impression of that person from the past.
Still, at what time exactly did the prince reincarnate?
“When I had a high fever at five, I got transmigrated into this body. How about you, prince?”
“At seven. I fell off a horse and hit my head. And when I came to…”
Well, we both got reincarnated at almost the same time, I guess.
In the previous world, I was older by two years, and now we have changed places in this, too.
“Prince, do you want to continue dating despite the change of sexes?”
“If you’d like to, then I am not against it. It’s good to have another person with whom you can share the secret.”
We then firmly shook hands.
What’s with this all? Were we connected by a red thread of fate?
Even though I still can’t remember my previous name one bit, how I looked then is also impossible to imagine now.
I thought to leave the detailed talks for a later date, but it was not to be.
The prince, who realized that he had seen the dollhouse in my room, bugged me to show it to him.
Now that I think about it, in the past, she liked this stuff.
She couldn’t make it herself but was keen on gazing at it and arranging it in different ways.
Also, the one who got me addicted to the nui culture was her. And now it’s my turn to teach her about all this.
No wonder, seeing as how she bit into nuis the second she saw them.
After hearing my explanations concerning the dollhouse, it again went to talk about mass-producing it, whatever the cost.
Ah. I just see how Father is going to be pushed again into troublesome stuff.
Fight on, Father!
------------------ 
Chapter 41 – Let’s grasp the current situation once again!Sup.
The prince is going to visit today again.
Thanks to His Highness telling his parents about his desire to deepen our relationship, and with that, the unnecessariness of the overly formal and stiff greetings, I was finally relieved from the need to go through the grueling 4-hour quest ever again.
Hell yeah.
And, as with the other day, we borrowed the arbor again and are currently drinking tea.
All to confirm our situation.
“And just like that, the little Miranda, who seemed to repeat her life in this world time and again, finally got tired of that and asked the already dead me to change places with her.”
Hearing my story, the prince got a serious expression on his face.
“Is that so. On the Teal’s side, there wasn’t anything like that.”
“Who’s Teal?”
“Dotteal’s pet name. Mother calls me that. You can also call me like that.”
“Is that really alright?”
“Well, while we organized our thoughts all this time, there were no people who tried to voice their complaints, so isn’t it fine?”
Since I honestly told the prince about Lady Tolastina’s intentions, he seemed to be satisfied with them.
That’s all good and well, but suddenly using a pet name isn’t too much?
“Well, using the full name is a mouthful, so nickname it is.”
“Miranda’s name is easy to pronounce, though.”
“Gee, thanks.”
I took a gulp of tea.
Ahh, so relaxing… Okay, onto the main topic.
“We got reincarnated like this, but I think this world is really a world from some game, don’t you think?”
“Eh, dunno.”
“Hey now.”
Don’t throw in the towel that quickly, prince.
“You should know I didn’t play otome games.”
“That’s true… Only RPGs were on your mind. And charage.”
“You did play a lot of different games, didn’t you, Miranda? And western ones, too.”
“And due to this, I’m not familiar with otomege.”
“Okay, this discussion is over~”
“Welp. I can only live as I please now.”
I stretched myself quite hard.
I got tired of speaking in a small voice between us.
“Hahhh. Lord Teal, how about we change the venue? It has become a little cold.”
“That’s some acting skill you have there. How quick you are at changing gears.”
“I am a duke’s daughter, after all.”
“I need to learn from your example.”
“Looking at you getting by fine despite your sex change, aren’t you managing well?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Laughing at this, we moved to the mansion’s reception room.
Now then, we’ve got to act like proper aristocrats from now on.
“By the way, Miranda. I want to see your dollhouse again. Is it possible?”
“Yes, of course it is, Lord Teal. It seems you got quite taken with it.”
“You were quite adept at using your hands even then.”
“When was that “then”?”
“Oops… Forgive me.”
Ohohoho… Your Highness, please do not forget to wear your mask properly. I beg you.
Let’s take this secret about us to the grave together~
After playing with Teal, arranging nuis and accessories, and doing whatever play we could, it was time to talk business.
“Looking from the perspective of the Kingdom, craftmakers are the backbone of the industry, so I by all means want them to build the necessary expertise with making this kind of luxury item and have the industry thrive.”
“I see. It is a splendid idea. Being able to use precision crafting techniques is very important for the development of the heavy industries.”
If there was a technology for recreating the dollhouse, which is a 1/12-sized model of a house, then it would be possible to advance the evolution of the current pendulum clocks.
In that case, shouldn’t the upper echelons of the country start standardizing the production methods right now?
You can’t really hope to be able to connect the different parts of the dollhouse-type toys if the makers are different without it, no?
There’s no need to use something like the two-by-four method for now; just having the ability to match the scaled sizes is already a big plus for future manufacturers and industries.
I should consult with Father, too, about this kind of thing.
------------------ 
Chapter 42 – Birth of the MIS (Mirandiehl Industrial Standard)Today, I, the prince, Father, and bigshots from both the craftsmen and carpenter guilds from our territory have gathered in the same room for a discussion.
Thanks to Teal’s earnest plea to buy the dollhouse he was enamored with even in the past life, after consulting with Barth the craftsman, who declared his inability to make it by himself, we decided to place an official request to the guilds of our territory.
Meaning that the work of creating the different parts would be divided between them.
Still, while both guilds do have some parts that can be used, the basis on which their measuring devices work is different, which could lead to disconnects in the dimensions of the completed parts.
That’s why, were we to try and assemble the requested parts together, there could appear to be a problem with the parts’ ends not meshing or the impossibility of them connecting at all.
The dolhouse is really small, so even a 1 mm difference would be apparent to the eye.
For example, if there was a 1 mm gap on the flooring of the 1/12 scaled model that the dollhouse is, on the real house it comes out at 1,2 cm.
A defective housing is what you get! Would you like to buy one?
With this, you really need strict unification of the measurement methods, tolerances, and blueprint drawing methodologies.
The carpenter guild did use the 3-sided drawing method, but the craftsmen guild did not, and people there didn’t know how to read it.
Therefore!
With Father’s promise to help, it was decided first to try and unite the production standards in the Mirandiehl territory.
The early bird catches the worm.
If we are successful, it could become the standard specification for the whole Karpf Theria Kingdom.
With that said, today we are conducting the signing ceremony for the Mirandiehl Industrial Standard, or MIS for short.
It took three months from the first talk to the realization.
Teal’s birthday would be held soon. Hahaha!
To give you the breakdown for the time each phase took, it would be like this: 1 month for ironing out the standard, 1 month for conducting the tests, and 1 month for fixing the discrepancies found during testing.
The dollhouse we ended up making during the test period was created using the blueprints drawn up by me after sizing down our mansion with the help of reconstruction records that were brought to light by our butler Sebastian.
Midway through, I was visited by Lady Cascia and Lady Tolastina, and, thanks to me showing everyone during my birthday party the Sages of the Round Table’s dollhouse, the texture of the product turned out superb.
The girls said that they’d like to try and create it for themselves and asked me if they could buy the dollhouse from me.
Next time, we will be holding a comparison fair of the dollhouses Lady Cascia and Lady Tolastina would make. Can’t wait.
“With this, I announce here and now that for the making of manufactured goods in the Mirandiehl territory, the MIS specifications standard is approved for use.”
With Father signing the document as the lord of the land, the MIS has been put into effect.
Good, good.
Also, the instruments for standardizing were selected.
Though, in reality, it’s just using preexisting tools with adjustments applied to them as a basis. With the progress of the sciences, I am sure that the norms will be revised a lot more in the future.
For now, it’s only applied to woodworking and precise crafts; when the heavy industry starts taking off, these preparations will surely serve as a really strong foundation.
“It’s now done, Lord Teal. The production factory for producing standardized dollhouses works flawlessly.”
“Thank you, Miranda. The funds I recklessly threw at it will be recovered with this.”
Ehh. You can say that again, Teal. Really.
Due to his desire to see the dollhouse made as soon as possible, he got up and went to build the factory right there and then.
Thanks to that, the necessity for unification became apparent, and it was hastily enacted.
After all, the cue for the MIS’s creation was the disconnect between the measurements of the same goods produced by different ateliers.
Anyway, what’s with the big idea of mass-producing the dollhouse on a large scale, huh?
It’s all well and good that the sales for the future product looked promising, but, prince, is it really alright?
It looks like I’d need to take his reigns into my own hands.
------------------ 
Chapter 43 – Prince Dotteal’s birthday (1)After this time’s early rude awakening, I was made to attend to the things I have missed for some time, then changed clothes to the dress Teal sent to me the other day, and now I’m riding in a shaking horse-drawn carriage.
I haven’t had time to get some grub, though?
Still, there’s no need for more bitching and whining now.
Because today, starting at noon, we will be celebrating Teal’s birthday.
As it’s his tenth birthday, it means that they will be announcing his fiancee.
The fact that this fiancee is me has already been long known among the high-ranking noble circles; the ones who aren’t in the know are the count families and below.
Why, you ask?
That’s because Teal was frequenting my house so much, on top of us having a hand in developing the dollhouse manufacturing methods.
Add to that his not visiting the house of Lady Tolastina, one of his supposed fiancee candidates, even once!!!
Truthfully, the Arkrays have already been contacted with the information that, on the inside, it was confirmed that I was the fiancee. As for Lady Tolastina, she’ll have her loved one taken into her family.
According to her, the man is quite handsome and, despite that, also cute.
That’s how love makes people behave, eh?
The color of today’s dress is close to the color of Teal’s hair. A yellow princess line garment coupled with a red ruby necklace and hair accessories; the color of his eyes.
This made me give off an impression of his possession. It took 15 minutes from being stuffed into the carriage to arrive.
The road was unexpectedly empty, so we took less time.
Compare that to the time we went to the tea party, when it took 30 minutes.
The carriage stopped at the rear entrance to the palace; the coachman opened the door for me, and there stood Teal, waiting for me.
“Miranda! Today, you are simply striking!”
“Good morning for you, Prince Teal. I thank you for this dress you have sent me as a gift.”
“Yep, yep, my eyes haven’t betrayed me. You look lovely in this dress, almost like a doll, and even more with it.”
I suspected your hand in this; I truly did.
In her past life, she dabbled in cosplaying, I think. When we were dating, we had already graduated, so I only know this from the photos, but she often wore costumes of characters from shounen manga that were popular among women.
In that sense it could be said that now she play out her craving for women fashion through me, now that she’s no longer a woman. I permit it.
Since I, too, wanted to wear cute clothes!
Now that I’m a girl, why not wear something stylish?
I don’t want to spend money, though.
Teal brought me and my parents, who came with me, into a palace’s antechamber.
Hey, is it alright to have the prince guide us?
When I took a glance at my parents behind me, they warmly smiled and looked at us both.
Ah, I see. It’s all good, then.
“Okay, Miranda. When the luncheon starts, I’ll come to get you. We’ll be entering together.”
“I understand, Your Highness.”
What now, Teal? What’s with the strange face?
Hm? I need to lend you my ear?
“Can’t you stop calling me that?”
“At least until the betrothal is announced, I need to call you Your Highness before the audience. It will be rude otherwise.”
“Then, when it’s done, no more formalities.”
“I understand. I promise, we’ll do as you proposed.”
Sporting smiles on our faces, we distanced ourselves from each other and bid a temporary farewell.
“What an affectionate closeness you have.”
It’s good that Mother is having a good time, but she will hardly notice the depth of desire that’s swirling inside me.
In reality, at the time Teal sent me the dress, we had exchanged the secret promise that when I would be playing a dress-up doll for him, he would do the same.
After all, we have reincarnated as a beautiful girl and a handsome boy. Who wouldn’t want to try on different clothes? We’d certainly try.
I want to fulfill my desire to have a handsome man to turn into otoko no ko.
My stock of handmade dresses for Teal to wear is currently growing.
How will it turn out, I wonder~
Ah, I mustn’t forget about a wig, too.
It’s quite pricey, that thing…
------------------ 
Chapter 44 – Prince Dotteal’s birthday (2)My parents went out of the antechamber first, and I was left alone.
Teal will come and get me later, as he said. I’m free for now.
Looking absentmindedly at the outside, I notice how citizens outside the castle’s walls are laughing and clamoring, celebrating His Highness’s birthday.
It looks like a typical festival, to be honest.
For the people, the prince’s birthday is just a convenient pretext, and I think that they’d still be celebrating whatever event is occurring then.
That’s what not having a TV or radio does for you.
While the books do exist, they are costly for an ordinary person; as for the schools, they are available at churches on Sundays only, I heard.
Now, if I think about it, I don’t really know how an ordinary citizen lives his life.
Today is the announcement of the bethrotal. When Teal turns twelve, he will be recognized as a Crown Prince, while I’ll be the future Crown Princess, so I really have to grasp these kinda things as soon as possible.
Uhm, it’s unexpectedly annoying.
Starting next month, I will be having a queen’s education, and it begs the question of how much free time I will have left then.
Privately, our faction and the allied faction of the duke Karpf Tetra want to establish a constitutional monarchy in the state. While the Arkray duke has an opposite stance, there’s already a citizen’s assembly, and if the nobles don’t start thinking about how to govern, they can face the citizenry’s opposition.
Could it be that Miranda had to suffer the loops because something like the French Revolution occurred and she was one of the executed there?
“Miranda, thank you for waiting.”
While I thought of this and that, Teal finally came for me.
Linking our arms, we went to the venue.
Yep, it’s kind of a new experience.
That’s because when we were dating then, we hardly held each other’s hands.
“It feels good to be escorted like this, no?”
“Having a cute girl walking by your side makes it quite fulfilling. Though I’m an old guy on the inside.”
“Didn’t we promise not to speak about it?”
We arrived at the place while whispering to each other.
At the entrance stood His Majesty the King and Her Majesty the Queen.
“Forgive us for having you wait for us.”
“It brings me joy, seeing such a cute girl to have as my future daughter-in-law.”
The king has said this to me. Kinda embarassing.
By the way, it’s my second time seeing the king.
He’s quite different from Teal, what with his well-built physique and all.
The only similarity he has is his hair and eye color.
Thank God for Teal’s resemblance to his mother, the queen.
Also, recently, I started to like compliments saying that I’m cute, beautiful, or whatever.
Well, I am cute! Wahaha.
Under the sound of trumpets, both Highnesses have entered, and we came after them.
“Everyone, raise your heads. I thank you for celebrating my son’s, Dotteal’s, birthday today. In addition, we will be presenting to the people his betrothed.”
Hearing my name being whispered, I take one step forward.
Executing a perfect curtsey, I raise my head.
“Let me introduce myself. I am the first daughter of the duke Mirandiehl, called Miranda Mirandiehl.”
I bowed again. After it, I moved to stand beside Teal.
“Yes. While Miss Miranda is still eight, her appearance is lovely, and she’s a lady full of wit. Her queen’s education should start next month. Still, I ask you to warmly welcome her.”
With this, the royal speech is over.
Next is the buffet-style luncheon.
At present, I and Teal, standing together, are being greeted by various nobles.
Hey, let me have a bite already, eh?
“Lady Miranda, thank you very much.”
“Lady Tolastina, here you should say, “Congratulations,” remember?”
“My, ohoho.”
What a jokester you are! See what difficult expression the Arkray duke is now making with his face?
“Well, I have to give thanks to Miss Mirandiehl for my daughter being able to connect with her loved one.”
“You are thanking me?”
“Hahaha, it seems you are quite a peculiar lady yourself. His Highness Dotteal will have his hands full, I am sure.”
“Yes, you are quite right.”
What gives, Teal?
Later, having finished greeting Lady Cascia and other big shots from our faction, we were released.
Finally, some grub.
“Miranda, I see it all in your expression.”
“I am sure you can see my hunger there.”
“Try at least to pretend, or something.”
“Nah, I’m beat.”
Teal brought with him a sandwich-looking thing and, after biting into it, sighed.
“Yep, nothing special.”
“It’s not tasty?”
“No, just plain and unassuming.”
“I bet. The taste is so-so for the things here.”
“Come eat our cuisine the next time. It’s good.”
“Did you improve it?”
“Somewhat.”
“Then don’t mind if I do.”
“Should I give you our cook?”
“That’s… I’ll think about it when I try the food you have.”
Really? Probably because the prince isn’t allowed in the kitchen, he hasn’t been able to revolutionize the food at the palace.
Since the Mirandiehl territory is facing the sea, we do have the custom of making stock soup and stuff.
Thanks to this, the food is great there.
It’s not like I invented the whole thing; I only encouraged cooks to try and make a stock soup from kombu that’s being thrown out.
All our broths have this added to them!
I guess I should have a lunch party for Teal’s sake next time.
Thus, Teal’s birthday party has come to a peaceful end.
Also, I wonder if the other girls have crowded around him or not.
------------------ 
Chapter 45 – Queen’s education and tea times with TealHeya, Miranda salutes you!
One month has passed since Teal’s birthday, and my queen’s education has started.
As there were no problems with my basic academic knowledge, I was to learn the neighboring countries’ languages, dining, and greeting etiquette.
Also, in addition to that, there were studies concerning our country’s state of affairs.
The Queen’s duty is to be a country’s representative as its first lady; besides, her main work is to oversee the charities managed by the state. It feels like what I study now has gone a step further than my previous studies about society.
Talking about the languages, you see, in my past life, I was shit at English, but here, the languages of the other countries are, in essence, the same but differ from each other only in small things like intonation and pronunciation, and that’s it.
Like Tokyo-ben and Kansai-ben.
Well, depending on the place, your words can be understood as they are or not. Something along these lines.
Thank goodness I don’t need to learn a whole different language. I can get by somehow.
It’s just that if you go over the ocean, those places’ languages are all incomprehensible nonsense. Though I don’t need to learn them, as there would be an interpreter provided. Good, good.
But at least I know how to do greetings and self-introductions.
As our territory does international trade, I was taught it from a young age.
Okay, the education itself is held in the royal palace and usually ends in the morning.
We go together with Father there, and when the lessons end, I return home after having tea with Teal.
Due to his strong desire for me to visit him, we do it every time without fail.
Oftentimes, we talk about what was taught to us that day, how the dollhouse factory is nowadays, and other stuff without much substance.
Can you call this a date?
I think it’s more like it than what we did in our past lives.
This month, aside from weekends, I study every day, but starting the next month, I will have 3 free days, and then I plan on calling the prince to my home.
I’ve gotta put the words of my promise from the other day into practice.
“By the way, what about your stargazing?”
“I’m still observing Jupiter every day. If possible, I’d like to find Uranus, though I don’t know from where I should start looking.”
“I don’t understand what you are trying to say.”
“It’s hard to find where exactly in the expanse of space I should aim my gaze or what point I should use as the starting place. Introduce me to someone knowledgeable.”
“Does it even exist here, though?”
“Dunno. If there were some scholar who could calculate a planet’s mass or orbit, I think it’d be possible to deduce the estimated position based on gravitational fluctuations. And find the asteroid belt.”
“I’ll try asking if there is someone well versed in this.”
“Please.”
With all said and done, there aren’t any decent theaters or something for your pastime, so having these kinda talks is fun.
Ahh, the tea at the palace is goood.
“By the way, I recall you being familiar with military things.”
“Hm? If you are asking about historical strategies or tactics, I do know some from the modern era, but if it’s about the Middle Ages, then no.”
I was more or less a military otaku before, so I do have knowledge about military ranks or war doctrines to a certain extent. We talked about this in the previous world, too.
Even though the genres were different, both I and Teal liked history and, as such, had information about the things of the past.
“It’s enough. The Karpf Theria Kingdom has the army and the navy, but as you’d expect, they don’t get along at all.”
“Ah, the faction disputes, I presume?”
“Something like that.”
“I understand. Can you tell me about the actual military power of our army? If I have this, I can think of something, I guess.”
“I got it. Let me prepare it for you.”
“Hm. But can a fiancee stick her head into this kinda thing?”
There’s the deal with military secrets and whatnot.
“It’s a valid concern, but the queen’s education does teach it. The one who guides the army as its supreme leader is the king, but the second leader is the queen, after all.”
“Hmm. I got it. If so, then I’ll try to make up a suggestion or two later.”
Yeah, I didn’t and still don’t know things like the war potential of the army and others.
I do know of the existence of the Order of Magic Knights, to which my Brother belongs, but aside from that, nothing.
What other Orders are there, I wonder~?
------------------ 
Chapter 46 – Reforming the militaryI have looked through the documents Teal has sent me.
That is, the list outlining the organization of our Karpf Tetra’s military.
You can’t really put the concrete number of the people serving there in such a freely available document, but it at least has what corps we have here written in it.
With the king at the top, next come an army general and a navy general in case of his death… Troublesome.
The army has… the Order of Magic Knights at the top, the Dragoon Order (?), a cavalry division, infantry, and guards.
The navy has… it counts troops by ship, it seems, 10 ships of the line and 50 frigates…
While our country faces the sea, only Mirandiehl and Arkray territories have a port, so it’s not that big of a fleet.
The naval port is in Arkray territory. All the high-ranking officers come from there, too.
Uhm, so they don’t have headquarters…
Well, in this era when the only means of communication are letters that need to be delivered as fast as possible, creating a command center to coordinate the whole military is very hard… Though the problem lies in bad relations between both parties of the country’s forces.
Wait. Since the magic exists here, aren’t there any fast methods of relaying the information on the battlefield and sitreps here?
If we use it and have both the army and the navy hold joint military exercises, can’t we slowly but surely go in the direction of establishing a future headquarters?
And what’s this Dragoon Order? Do we have dragons here? Can it be used as an air force, then?
I should ask Teal about anything I don’t know.
“That’s why, by creating a general staff headquarters commanding the whole military and having the Dragoon Order belonging to the army be an independent air force, I think we can expand our possible range of operations.”
“Right. The Dragoon Order is a corps of dragon-riding knights, and that’s why you want them as an air force?”
“If we understand a dragon’s maximum load-carrying capacity, couldn’t we have them perform bombing if possible?”
“Bombing, you say.”
“Yes, if you can bring a bomb with you to the sky, aerial bombardment is possible.”
The current warships excel in the defense of their flanks but have no ability to shield themselves from the air, and at the time of a naval battle, you can just dispatch a dragon and overturn the tide of the battle in one swoop.
“Also, if we go this way, we’d need to develop countermeasures against the other countries’ dragon knights, I think.”
“It’s as you say. Such a knight would be able to utterly destroy a land force with a single breath of his dragon, and as such, this could serve the role of keeping the other countries’ similar forces in check.”
“Then, we must think of personal or individual equipment for a dragon. For this, we need to introduce the idea of an arsenal that will undertake the development and transport method of the armaments.”
“An arsenal?”
“It’s absolutely necessary to incorporate the advancement in the field of designing new methods of doing battles with the use of newly invented weapons, created based on the ever-changing way of waging war. Our task is to make a plan on how to transport and decide on what place to prioritize for sending those weapons. It all should be put in the hands of the headquarters.”
“In other words, with that place having the decision-making power concerning the equipment, you want to have it oversee the whole military?”
“That’s right. If the army and the navy are left on their own, even if one develops something, the skill pool between the forces will become unbalanced, and we will be left with a bunch of unusable trash instead of military.”
“Miranda, thank you. If there is something I don’t understand, please teach me once again.”
“I am available for you anytime. I will serve you well.”
After this, we had one more week of lengthy discussions during tea time about all things military. But at this time, I haven’t had even a small inkling that, in a couple years, His Majesty the King will personally summon me to come to him.
------------------ 
Chapter 47 – Having a great time with friendsThe one who heard about the difficulty of the queen’s education but found it to be not a big deal—that’s right, it’s me, Miranda.
After all, it’s not like I have it every day, and that being an extended study of the previous lady’s education and all I’ve learned so far, that’s why it’s no big deal.
But I do feel the increase in my ladylikeness nonetheless.
So, today we are having tea at Lady Cascia’s house.
There’s still time until the social season. That’s why I decided to try and have some of those tea get-togethers at my friend’s before it starts.
I rarely talk about socializing and stuff, so the others started getting the impression that I’m withdrawn and such.
It’s not like that, you know? I definitely hold a tea party at least once a month, visit my friends’ houses, have guests at mine, and participate in mingling.
Though if you ask me if I go out in town, the answer is no.
I’ve only ever gone to my friends’ mansions or the palace, and that’s it.
A perfect example of a sheltered girl.
And I didn’t even go out incognito, nor do I plan to.
Whatever make-up I’d use for an outing, the only thing that awaits me is kidnapping.
Better yet, not only Father but even Teal have stopped me from attempting to go to town.
This happened just recently, when I went to the palace for a tea party.
“Miranda, I trust you don’t go to town?”
“No, I don’t. Father discouraged me from doing so, and I myself don’t quite require it, as I’m not inconvenienced in any way.”
“Hm, I’d like you to continue doing so. Your white skin and beautiful straight platinum blond hair in a hime cut style, however you try and rearrange them, will definitely show you as a lady born to money who hasn’t worked a day under the sun. There is absolutely no chance of going out for you.”
“What if I change my hairstyle?”
“It won’t fly, as where else would you ever see such a perfect face in the streets? You’d definitely be kidnapped. Please don’t make me experience a heart attack in the future.”
“Does that mean that you went out to town?”
“A prince should know the life of his people living in the castle town as a part of his education.”
“So I can just ask you about the town’s happenings, then.”
“I’d appreciate you doing exactly that.”
In this way, I can only guess at the state of things in the town through hearsay brought by Teal and base it off of the numbers I see in my queen’s education.
In the future, I will be attending the citizens’ assembly hall, I hear, and I eagerly await the time it will be done.
“Lady Cascia, I thank you for inviting me today.”
“No, it was I who troubled you with it, so I should thank you, Lady Miranda.”
“Lady Tolastina, good day to you too.”
“You are quite late, Lady Miranda.”
We are already a close group.
Royalist Mirandiehl’s, center-right Arkray’s, and center-left Karpf Tetra’s high-ranking nobles’ daughters.
In Karpf Tetra, there’s no marquess daughter who would be above Lady Cascia.
That’s to say, it’s quite an odd state of things, where the daughters of the three top factions are close friends.
By all rights, we’d have been tools in the factions’ fights, where each faction tries to vie for influence, but with me becoming Teal’s betrothed, as a result, we are able to be friends with each other.
There are also similarities in our interests at play.
Lady Cascia is very interested in dolls and fortune-telling, while Lady Tolastina adores plush toys.
Despite them being from the country’s top families, if you get to know them better, they are very open-hearted. It’s fun talking with them.
The sight of three beauties frolicking warms my heart.
It brings me joy.
The only flaw in the otherwise impeccable Lady Tolastina is her propensity to dive into plushies when she visits my house.
And often both of them say to me that “it sometimes feels like I am talking with some uncle from an extended family,” so I am worried that the truth of who I am is going to be uncovered sooner or later.
------------------ 
Chapter 48 – I’m having a great time at home, tooHeya. It’s me. You know who.
If you ask me what I’m doing with my time, I’d answer that, recently, I’ve been trying to make the dollhouse bit by bit.
As for the stargazing, I continue to engage in it, though without new discoveries, it’s kinda eh.
Now I’m fed up with it.
It’d have been better if the telescopes here were more advanced, but how to make them so, I don’t know.
Also, the other day I heard that there are reflecting telescopes here.
This field is better left to experts, I suppose. When I go to school, I’ll definitely find one.
Yeah, this Karpf Theria Kingdom is such a country, where you enroll in the school for aristocrats at twelve, graduate at fifteen, and start being considered an adult at the same time.
When I turn fifteen, I will be married to Teal.
Now then. My plan to create a dollhouse of the mansion we have in the capital is proceeding smoothly.
As for the foundational part of the thing, the scaled-down rooms are made with the help of MIS, for which I got the walls and the floor made, and my work is creating the interior for them.
Making the furniture is unexpectedly fun.
Getting my hands on the carving knife and the craft knife from the craftmakers guild, made easier to handle with wood processing by the carpenter guild, is quite a boon.
At first, I wasn’t particularly dextrous with its handling, but nowadays I am able to recreate the furniture from our house that is similar in design.
In addition, I was able to make knickknacks from paper clay and produce embroidered curtains for a one-person room.
Despite me living here for a long time already, I didn’t really know what rooms we had in which parts of the mansion, so now I’m burning with passion to know everything.
The maids’ rooms are personal ones; the servants have their own separate building; and the mansion’s guard knights’ bunking place, which I got to know previously, was inspected. Knowing all of this, I understood the style of various pieces of equipment used in the capital.
Well, the equipment is made mainly for the guards, so there are no large-scale ones.
They usually use swords and shields, and no equipment from other knight orders was present there.
I’d certainly like to see a knight’s order’s equipment in full sometime.
And I also have an interest in knowing the scope of things used by the army at this time.
Don’t forget about the existence of magic! Of course, I am curious about how the weapon system is organized here.
The history of an army reflects the history of a country! In the future, I’ll ask Teal to let me visit an inspection of the army.
It’s my dream to revolutionize weapons.
Though, as there’s magic, is it possible that they already have troops in possession of the means of long-distance attack and flying?
I didn’t see any guns after all.
Okay, the dollhouse is good and all, but now it takes up a whole room for itself.
To tell the truth, this room is actually the place for my dancing lessons, but, as I have started getting the queen’s education at the palace, the room now sits unused and consequently has been turned into a place where the capital’s mansion is being made.
Hey, but isn’t this supposed to be highly classified? Now I’m a little worried.
I have quite meticulously recreated all rooms’ placements, after all.
Still, there are some closed-off rooms and places with restricted entry; the space for them in the dollhouse is left blank.
Even the duke’s daughter can’t possibly be allowed to go where she pleases!!!
Thanks to this, parts of the dollhouse are empty. A space with only walls and nothing else, if you will.
I am sure that those spaces are the rooms reserved for the spies we have living here.
Well, since I was okayed to create the whole thing, I guess it’s nothing to worry about.
------------------ 
Chapter 49 – The social season is upon us, and I get invited to the party commemorating the military’s establishmentSup, it’s… Miranda again, yes.
The winter social season is now open.
When I asked Teal the other day, “Now that I think about it, after changing your sex, are your romantic interests still guys?” at which he answered, “Nah, spare me from being the MC of a BL game.”
Besides, as a prince, he must produce an offspring, and who better to do it with than Miranda, who is a person of known disposition?
The hell is that? Don’t get all smart with me here. Though I don’t dislike it, far from it.
Also, despite my being an old guy, my preferences, much like Teal’s, haven’t changed, though I don’t particularly hold any attraction to women.
I just didn’t want to be embraced by a man, and that’s all. A mystery.
During this year’s social season, we as the Mirandiehl family held tea parties and evening parties, and after participating in the celebrations for the National Day held by the royal family, I thought that finally, it’s all over now, but Teal has suddenly invited me to the party celebrating the military’s establishment.
Eh, what now? I don’t wanna go.
As I mulled over what dress I should wear to the party, Teal sent me one, easing my worries.
You’re strangely prepared for all this.
And I feel like I was treated as a dress-up doll for him, even though I hadn’t gotten a chance to do the same to him.
When the dress was delivered, I couldn’t find any words to say.
“Isn’t this a military loli design?”
The design itself was reminiscent of the military uniforms of the Karpf Tetra army; there were lovely frills added to the gray knight’s clothes, and the skirt was about an ankle’s length. Overall, it’s close to what you’d call a military lolita dress.
Furthermore, it’s a bastardized version of what officers wear.
Is this okay? I won’t get stabbed in the back for this, yes?
Teal, I’m now gonna make even more girlish clothes for you. Just wait…
“I am happy that you came dressed like this, Miranda.”
“I get you for this.”
“I have resolved myself for when the season ends.”
“A wig is waiting for you, okay?”
“Really…”
While whispering to each other like this, we went to the venue.
Big Brother Grande will be present at this party, but will I have time to speak with him, I wonder?
After entering, I saw that the interior was beautifully done in two colors.
Black and white.
Brother wore a white outfit, so the army uses that color. Then the black is for the navy people… So that’s why my clothes are gray. So as not to pick sides.
Teal, too, is wearing a gray military uniform.
“How eagerly they all have divided into two colors.”
“The relations aren’t that good, after all. So as to eradicate this problem, today your proposed general staff headquarters’ establishment will be announced, and all people here are on egde. Everyone wonders who will benefit the most.
“Ah. The military infighting is so tiresome.”
“His Majesty the King has now arrived!”
Some time after our entry, the king’s arrival was announced.
Oh, he’s also wearing a gray military uniform. Wait. Now I wonder, “What color did our kingdom’s royalty wear before?”
“All present here today, with the consolidation of the military administration, the army, the navy, and the recently established air forces, here and now I announce the formation of the general staff headquarters that will serve as a command center for giving orders to the whole military. The GSH, where all top officers from all forces will gather, will…”
Oho? Didn’t His Majesty just up and adopt the rough draft I submitted to him as-is? Guess not.
Would that be fine, though? Even if I am a duke’s daughter, it’s scary to have adopted what essentially is a child’s proposal, so I’m sure the adults, together with the king, have smoothed out all the edges it had.
“Moreover, the one who gave me this proposal was none other than Mirandiehl’s daughter, who, lamenting the sad state of affairs between the army and the navy, appealed to me. Her judgment was logical, and immediately after judging that for future military progress, both the army and navy should break out of the box of inward thinking and that their integration is of the utmost importance.”
Stoooooooop!!! Why did you say my name for everyone to hear?! They are now looking at me!!!
I can’t give them detailed explanations if anyone tries to ask, though!!!
“Now then, enjoy today’s commemoration party. The details will be communicated at a later date.”
What a bombshell you dropped there, bastard.
With His Majesty finishing his speech, it’s now free for all, isn’t it?
What to do…
------------------ 
Chapter 50 – No incidents were reportedA little girl, surrounded by rough-looking military people, was saved from this criminal predicament by Teal.
So manly. Despite him being an old woman on the inside.
A lot of the questions asked were about the separation from the army and the establishment of the air forces made out of the dragon cavalry.
The dragon cavalry. The decision was born out of judging that with the current strategies, they were wasting their talents.
And because a lone dragon by itself doesn’t really have that much offense.
Previously, I thought that if all the dragons were to spew their breath, swipe down enemies with their long tails, and serve as a countermeasure against enemy dragoons, it could work, but alas, only a small number of them are capable of this.
Not every dragon can use their breath to attack just because they are dragons.
As such, it was quite expensive for the deployment branch of the army, whose main duty was to provide urgent aid during times when monsters attacked by using their roar for intimidation and overpowering them.
That was no dream world of dragons streaking above battlegrounds and mowing enemies with fire.
Also, thinking of the fuel, or rather, feed costs, they were nothing to sneeze at, either.
The dragon-riding knights’ equipment was a great lance and shield, and for long-distance attacks, magic was used.
Truly a waste.
As a matter of fact, the wild dragons, using their naturally powerful legs, attack horse-drawn carriages, taking them away.
Hence, I thought, wouldn’t the cost be justified if this air force, by carrying the other troops on their backs, was used as a transport aid for a longer operational time of the supplying, bombing, and reconnaissance troops instead?
A carriage fully stocked with bombs has the power to destroy a castle or two, after all.
In the first place, with only the weight of such a massive object, it will have sufficient offense as a mass bombing device.
With the transport of the army supplies, the story is similar. Just use the dragons’ legs to carry them.
In other words, if we turn the dragons into specialized carrying craft, they can easily be used as a transport plane or a bomber.
As for a fighter to protect those dragons, you can use fast and flexible child dragons or those dragons that aren’t equipped with heavy armor.
After my patient and thorough explanations, the navy people were convinced.
Why them, you ask? Because, until now, the dragons were the property of the army, the navy couldn’t use them for themselves.
With this made possible, they don’t have any complaints now that the air forces are their own thing.
Just make a dispatch request to them, and the force can do reconnaissance from a high altitude and faster than any ship, and with the bombing of an enemy fleet, you can quite easily get the results without any worry.
Against monsters or pirates, too, the air force seems to be very effective.
I bet! For now, they will only be used for defense of the territorial waters, but, in the future, I wonder if someone will make an aircraft carrier or something.
At that point, even the army people gave a reluctant acknowledgement.
All because they are now free of the misery that was the management of the not-so-insignificant feed costs they were forced to shoulder if they wanted to sustain their fighting power.
Also, because the notion of the air force didn’t exist here before, for now it will be put to test.
The army people said that they would occasionally come to ask my opinion on that.
What are you asking a cute girl to do, you fiends!
Oh shit, I was the one who suggested it in the first place!
“You were a great help today, Miranda.”
“Teal… Really, just you wait. What did you make a little girl do!”
“Aren’t you a bit old to be called a little girl?”
“What do you want, handsome?”
“What do you want, cutie?”
Hahaha!
We both cracked up.
Darn, aren’t you a babe with that face, eh?
“Yeah, Miranda is cute, indeed.”
“I must return those words right at you, good sir.”
“Should I hold myself a little more manly, then?”
“Stop it.”
“Thought so.”
One thing or another, I and Teal are truly a match made in heaven, I thought.
Now, only National Day is left.
When that comes to a close, I will be nine years old.
------------------ 
Chapter 51 – Playing with the princeToday, His Highness will come visit our home!
To put it more bluntly, he’s gonna become my toy.
Since the end of the social season the other day, when the military establishment party was held, the dress I was wearing then has apparently made all female knights quite interested in it, and I heard rumors that they have appealed to have it turned into one of the official military uniforms.
Now you have done it, Teal…
After all, my specialty is the goth loli dress series. Thanks to this, we have started getting a lot more inquiries at Goth Miranda these days.
Military Gothic is cool; you can’t deny it. I have had a blast wearing it.
Dressing up does feel good sometimes.
But I’d never wear a gothic lolita dress! Nay!
Now, as I mentioned earlier, Teal will come to my home to be made into my plaything.
That is to say, he will be my dress-up doll.
In this country, it’s customary for men to gift women dresses, while women will mostly gift men things like handkerchiefs or other personal effects and don’t gift them clothes.
“Welcome to our home, prince Teal. Thank you for coming.”
“Hello, Miranda. I’ve come as I promised.”
“Today I’d like you to accompany me to lunch; would that be alright with you?”
“Ah, thank you. I was looking forward to this.”
“I don’t think our sandwiches are much different from yours. As for the soup and other things, I have confidence in their taste.”
“You do have a concept of using soup stock, after all…”
“We live beside the sea, so it wasn’t that hard to come up with it for anyone.”
Teal had a smile on his face.
You could see in his expression that he liked our stock soup with kombu.
“Let us proceed inside.”
With that, I ushered Teal to the guest room.
Only Lisa was accompanying me today.
I can’t have other maids to entrust with this, yep.
Only she can go along with my selfishness. She’s my accomplice.
Though it’s puzzling as to why she’d ascquiesce so easily…
It couldn’t be that she wants to see the prince dressed up, surely… Fufufu.
“Okay, Miranda. I’ll do whatever you want today.”
“Fufufu, the time of reckoning is now upon us! Brace yourself! Let’s start with this!”
A dress the color of my eyes! Wahaha!
Imma make this one handsome into otoko no ko!!!
“I hope that I’m right, but Lisa here will only be helping with my changing, right?”
“What are you saying? I’ll be helping too. I won’t let it end with being a simple fashion show.”
“Wa, wait. Wait just a minute. Isn’t it bad for not yet married men and women to show their skin to each other?!”
“Are you saying this now? Brace yourself!!!”
I and Lisa strip the prince down.
“I see. I see. Quite a slender and beautiful body, and not some macho, thankfully.”
“You have really feminine features.”
“Well, do you want to be embraced by a muscled man?”
“Nope.”
“That’s why I’m trying to hold off on building up my body as much as I can. I’d like you to praise me.”
“Good boy, good boy.”
“Am I a dog to you?”
Quickly dressing him, putting a wig on his head, and throwing a tiara there for good measure… we complete our work (for now).
“As expected, it fits you to a T.”
“Oh my, how unbelievably cute, aren’t I?”
“Surprisingly, you don’t even need any makeup.”
“It’s to be expected with my girly face. I’m glad that I don’t look like my father. I didn’t even notice it before.”
“Praise be to Her Majesty the Queen. Okay, now wear this.”
“Uwah, a goth loli dress.”
“Got a problem?”
I asked, peering at Teal’s face.
“No, well, it’s kinda off wearing this in my thirties, you know…”
He whispered that in my ear. It seems it did bother him, more or less.
“You’re still ten, aren’t you?”
“Right.”
Fufufu. I’ll let you know that I prepared a lot more clothes that nobody in this world has seen yet.
A bunny suit, a maid outfit with an uncomfortably short skirt, and also a police uniform with a miniskirt.
“Miranda, it’s too much!”
“Wh, whaaaat?!”
“Let’s at least wait until after our marriage.”
“So you will wear it then, yes? I’ll take you up on your words.”
“Wah… Now I’ve done it.”
Lisa was watching us with quite an incredible face.
You’ve already helped me with undressing the prince, so I’ll make you stick with me until the end.
With nothing else to do, I had Teal wear some other clothes, namely a bunch of different nightgowns, daily wear, and maid outfits that women working for our house are wearing, and after that, he returned to his normal look.
Maid Teal was so cute. So cute, you can’t help but want to bully him a little.
Now, I should reward him for sticking with me with our dishes at lunch.
------------------ 
Chapter 52 – Eating lunch with the princeThe cosplaying event finished.
Man, whatever you make the prince wear, it all looks good on him.
He passes for a truly good otoko no ko. With this, there’ll be no problem being held by him or hugging him myself.
When he grows, he’ll lose his angelic voice during puberty, but I can allow for this if it’s only this much.
“Now then, Lord Teal. Let us proceed to the dinner hall.”
“Lead the way.”
We headed off to dine together.
“Then, please enjoy the food.”
I gave a signal to the waitress. We’ll start with the soup.
This one is made of stock created by adding a large quantity of dried kombu, bones, and vegetables to a bouillon, making for a lightly flavored dish.
No garnishing today, so please enjoy the taste as-is.
Heh, that’s royalty for you; even Teal’s manners are a thing to behold.
“Yes, this is quite good! Such a profound taste!”
“Right? There’s only a pinch of salt and pepper in there, and that’s it.”
“And with that, to think it’s still so good. As expected, should I say?”
“There’s still an appetizer, and after that, the main dish is waiting, so please enjoy it.”
For the appetizer, we have marinated vegetables.
The one where you boil them some and soak them in marinade.
In this world, people don’t eat them raw.
As for the main dish, we have the previously mentioned bouillon and chicken meat stewed with tomatoes.
I like a lot more than beef and pork.
At last, after the appetizer, the main dish has arrived.
“A chicken leg with tomato stew. Help yourselves.”
“Bah!”
“What’s the matter, Teal?”
“You even have tomatoes here, I see.”
“Do you dislike it? Tomatoes? You can eat them, right?”
“Uh, well, that’s right, but, until now, I was told that it’s poison, so the palace still doesn’t serve them.”
I see? So that’s what this is about.
In our territory, we already have them as a part of our ration, though.
Ah, I should mention that a condiment similar to mayonnaise already exists here.
Steamed vegetables with mayonnaise are my favorite.
I also wondered if it was alright to eat eggs raw, and as it turned out, there was no problem.
“Isn’t the distribution of them on the market quite low in volume? I am amazed you could get your hands on them.”
“We grow them in the greenhouse.”
“Did you plant them?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Ahhh, I finally tasted some. These tomatoes are really tasty.”
“Right?”
“Can I come eat them once more?”
“OK.”
It makes me happy to see Teal satisfied with the tasty meal, yep.
“Certainly, if it’s possible, I’d like to borrow your cooks.”
“Should we start offering the tomatoes at the palace?”
“Ahaha, I would like to formally ask, though.”
“Then, I will as such.”
I have already consulted with Father about it, so if I say that the prince is of the same mind, I am sure everything will be done in short order.
Let the food revolution start at the palace!
I’ll make this country’s food even better!
It’s just that the people in our territory seem to be enjoying even better varieties of food.
They do eat fish raw and such.
Even without soy sauce, there’s a certain charm to being able to eat sashimi.
I still haven’t gone to the fief proper.
Frankly, I won’t go there just for some grub.
These days, as the prince’s fiancee, I am not allowed outside the capital unless it’s something serious.
There’s the queen’s education once every two days, and my study of magic still continues, too.
“Say, Teal. Can I come to your office next time?”
“I don’t mind, but what for?”
“Show me your wo~rk.”
“Understood. It’s very daunting, though.”
“Should I lend a hand?”
“Just don’t look through secret documents.”
“Aye, aye.”
Okay, the next time I’m free, I guess I’ll pay a visit to Teal’s office.
------------------ 
Chapter 53 – Preparations for the birthday partyOne month after the end of the social season, it’s soon time for my birthday.
By the way, this country doesn’t really have a concept of a “birth day.”
You get one year older in the month you were born.
Due to this, the month before Teal’s birthday party and the month after are full of celebrations. Easy to understand.
Lady Cascia’s is right during the social season, so the tea party there doubles as the birthday celebration.
It’s kinda like having your birthday coincide with Christmas.
This would be my first birthday party since becoming Teal’s fiancee, and as such, it will be held in a rented dining hall of the palace instead of our home.
Teal, you bastard, what are you scheming now?
And this is after saying that you’d love to do it at our home, where the food is better.
In aristocratic circles, the deliciousness of our cuisine has become quite a hot topic, so I’m sure nobody would complain about not being in the royal castle…
That said, this time not only Teal but his mother will be present, and so there is a need to up the security for the party.
I dislike all that formality, though.
By the way, the second the party at the palace was decided, Lady Tolastina suggested we hold a separate celebration among friends.
She probably wants to introduce her fiancé.
I do have some reservations about going into a den of females; my heart can’t possibly weather all that stuff. Probably?
Ah, I’ll have Teal with me, then. Problem solved.
My main issue for now is: what bait should I devise this time?
The previous one, “nui,” is still popular, and the sales of plushies based off of characters from the famous classic novels are going very well.
As expected, the male ones enjoy the most popularity.
Fuhaha. My comrades, fall even deeper down the rabbit hole!
Now that I have decided to have some entertainment at the party, what’s left is to decide what it will be.
I heard from Teal that things for dollhouses are now being sold.
The current ones are all the size of nuis, and that’s quite big.
You can’t really stuff them into a dollhouse unless it’s made large.
It will probably be good if I try to reduce the proportions of the toys.
As the concept isn’t strictly tied to using the world of fantasy in the novels, it might be good to try and create different types of settings for the house.
Like a certain wooden house a family of animals used.
Also, since I have recollections of building sims being sold here, wouldn’t it be just as well if I prepared some scaled-down versions of dollhouses geared toward small children and adults?
The question is, will I make it in time or not… I should inquire at the factory.
Later, we, together with Teal, were able to hold a meeting with the people from the factory.
“And that’s why, taking the concept of fairies as an inspiration, I propose the plan of selling a several sizes smaller one-room dollhouse conceptual series of houses based on existing in reality places, such as real knights’ guardrooms or a guest room of one’s home, aimed at adults, together with hard non-ball-jointed dolls.”
“I am quite interested in this. Could this be realized in time for Miranda’s birthday party?”
I was very worried about making this unreasonable demand they couldn’t refuse from the position of power we both hold, but the factory people turned out to be quite realistic.
“If we talk about having one of them each and the other as pictures, we can prepare something workable for Lady Miranda with her concept art.”
“Is it alright? Would that not be much to ask?”
“Do not worry, Lady Miranda. Recently, the sales of dollhouses have been on the decline, so your idea can give them some new spark. Especially the ones aimed at adults, which recreate real places, would be appealing for kids, too.”
“Can I ask you to make the doll not have distinctive features, please?”
“Understood.”
This quick acceptance and ending of the discussion was quite a letdown, to be honest.
It looks like the factory people, too, have thought up some plans for the future, so it was a lifesaver.
The power of the duke’s family money made this possible.
These days, I just periodically prepared various parts and, as such, made the things practically by myself, which made me lose some contact with the people here.
But now, I will only get the concept fees and plan to give the factory full creative authority.
It wouldn’t hurt if these dollhouses became even more popular. I’ll be receiving royalties for them after all.
------------------ 
Chapter 54 – The birthday party and the unveiling of a new dollhouse seriesGood morning, everyone. It is me, Miranda.
Today, since early morning, I’ve been in the palace. I have already become accustomed to visiting here.
The birthday party finally opened today.
As for the new type of dollhouse, I didn’t expect that it would really be completed in only two weeks.
Also, unlike the other times we celebrated, I see a lot of unrelated adults today who are not of any faction.
In that sense, it’s a good opportunity to announce all my merchandise. I have to have a lot of dresses for going to the palace, and as such, getting all the money I can here is a good strategy.
By the way, I don’t specifically dress up for the queen’s education. Simple daily clothes are good.
There’s no sense in wearing them only once and then throwing them away. I use them as much as I can. The only clothes I wear once are party dresses.
Anyway, after the familiar 4-hour morning torture, I am now on standby in the castle.
I still can’t get over the fact that in this country, the person who celebrates their birthday must organize the party themselves.
Well, let’s just think of it as a noble’s duty or something. Whatever.
“My lady, it is almost time.”
“Teal. I am going, okay?”
Me and Teal were having tea in one room of the palace, waiting for the opening time.
With Lisa’s reminder, I tried to stand up from my chair.
“Then I’ll go with you.”
“Eh?”
“It would be good for a fiancé to be beside you, no?”
“Is this really alright?”
With no real reason to refuse, we go together.
I’d need to greet each and every guest right now.
This time, the high-ranking nobles above the marquess, regardless of their faction affiliation, were invited here. Recently, I have finally managed to associate the names and faces of family heads of count families and above.
The families lower than that—it’s impossible; there are so many of them.
It’s like urging me to remember all the people working at the palace.
Ah, Lord Arkray.
“I thank you for coming to my party, Duke Arkray.”
“Hm, I see that you continue to be a good friend to my daughter. I am thankful.”
“I am, too, very grateful to Lady Tolastina for always worrying about myself.”
Duke Arkray nodded at my words.
Despite our factions’ differences, it’s not like we have a violent feud.
Moreover, if I were to serve as an intermediary, all would be well. It’s not like I want infighting to occur.
“Lady Miranda, I heard a rumor that you will be presenting something to us all today.”
“Yes. I am not sure if it will suit your tastes, Lady Tolastina, however.”
“Don’t be silly. I am always full of anticipation for anything concerning dollhouses.”
Ohohoho.
Honestly, you already know about this all, Lady Tolastina. You saw it the other day.
Your eyes were positively sparking at the sight of the fairy house.
The fairy dolls are also made for it, with their child-like bodies and transparent wings.
As it’s a product for aristocracy, a one-piece dress with a shork skirt won’t fly here, but even with a little long clothes, Lady Tolastina was hooked line and sinker.
Lady Cascia saw all the new products too, but in her case, she took a liking to the dollhouses aimed at adults.
As such, I think baiting the noble girls was a success.
This is why, with the opening of the birthday party, I got right to introducing the new series of ready-made dollhouses.
While I explained for future reference how it all works, what serves as a base for the merchandise, and what accessories are available, the noble ladies surrounded me.
Hey you, why don’t you bother Teal, too?
Now that I think about it, I don’t even remember girls swariming Teal since the bethrotal announcement once.
Is this country quite disciplined in this regard?
Nobody will bat an eye if a member of the royal family were to have a concubine or two, though the current His Majesty doesn’t have even one. Could it be that the culture is slowly changing here?
------------------ 
Chapter 55 – Paying a visit to the prince’s officeToday I went to the castle for my queen’s lessons.
After going here for more than a year, the place has become almost a second home for me.
That said, the places I can go to are the entrance, a ballroom a little farther from there, a library for studying, and a garden where we, together with Teal, have a tea, and that’s it. Not much of a variance.
I mostly haven’t gone to any of the offices of various departments, situated at the center of the castle proper.
I say mostly because, as part of the education, I have visited each section to get briefed on-site as to the work they are all doing.
At that time, I greeted people like the head of finances, the head of the judiciary, and the minister of foreign affairs.
The whole place has given me the impression of a government office complex for all the country’s ministries with its atmosphere.
Naturally, they were all placed in their own building, with the residence for the king’s everyday life being another big building, all of them situated on the same grounds.
Since the wars weren’t waged in recent times or something, the only military facilities in the royal castle were the ones for the Royal Guard Division and Magic Knights Order’s sections.
The army’s base seems to be situated somewhere else.
That’s why I haven’t seen any Dragon Knights in the town.
You can hardly miss them flying above. Though maybe I just haven’t noticed them if they fly without sound…
Today’s dance and the kingdom’s history lessons are coming to a close.
As they ended in the afternoon, after that, I immediately headed to Teal’s office.
“So as you can see, I came here to visit, Teal.”
“Welcome, Miranda. Sorry for the abruptness, but let me introduce these two.”
Teal, standing up from the table in the center of his room, purposefully went to greet me, smiling.
My, will you hug me, perhaps? Mwa-ha-ha.
These days, every time we meet, he hugs me.
It’s quite a pleasant and relaxing feeling, seeing as his frame is thin and his body is free of excess muscles.
What’s more, with Teal’s feelings being much the same, we are in the same boat.
I almost want to pretend that we’re two noble ladies, dress Teal in drag, and make him participate in some tea party together while I can.
With the hug’s ending, the prince gets to introduce the two men (?) to me.
From their looks, I’d say they are fifteen. Well, at this age, they are considered adults, so I may as well refer to them as such.
“This person here is my aide, the son of the count, Earlgrey Coffeemocca. The one sitting there is the son of the marquess, Darjeen Assam, councelor for national security.”
“Pfft.”
At my unintentional laugh, Teal only scowled.
“I do understand how you feel, but can you not do this? Even I still want to bash my head against the wall due to my name.”
He chided me, whispering in my ear.
Yep, the only one who will find this amusing will be a Japanese reincarnator.
In this world, tea does exist but not coffee, so there wouldn’t be brands like Earl Grey or Darjeeling or a place called Assam.
“Greetings to you both. I am the first daughter of the Mirandiehl duke family. My name is Miranda.”
Feeling sorry for laughing at their names without reason, I put all my acting skills to work and greeted them as a proper lady.
“Hello, I am Earlgrey.”
The first to greet me was quite a pretty boy, with his slim and tall body and brown hair.
He exuded masculine charm. I recall his family being from Karpf Tetra’s faction.
“I am Darjeen. It is an honor to be introduced to you, lady.”
This one was big and brawny.
He gives an impression of a man from an influential family in the military faction of the conservative and right-leaning duke Arkray.
“I see that Lord Coffeemocca is from Karpf Tetra and Lord Assam is from Arkray, but Teal, what’s with this selection, eh?”
“On the merit of their talents.”
“I see.”
Seeing my understanding, both of them had ghosts of smiles on their faces.
Whazzat?
“I heard rumors of the eccentricity of Lady Mirandiehl, and as I see, they are quite on point.”
Lord Earlgrey said so with a laugh.
“Really? Ah, call me Miranda.”
“Understood, Lady Miranda. Despite you being His Highness’s fiancee, it’s normal to be concerned about a person’s faction, but I didn’t expect you to be so understanding after hearing the basis for our selection.”
I see, so that’s what you mean.
Usually, you’d be concerned with all that faction crap.
I’m a weirdo for trying to build friendly relations.
My friendship with the daughters of each faction’s head is a testament to my eccentricity.
“If we were concerned with the factions’ relations in selecting people who will lead the country in the future, we could miss some outstanding people that way, don’t you think? I feel it would be quite a shame otherwise.”
“Truly, unlike a normal noble lady, you have a solid sense of propriety.”
Lord Darjeen seemed impressed with me.
But I don’t think that the daughters of high aristocracy are like that; just look at me and my friends.
“She’s my treasured fiancee, after all.”
“Stop it, Darjeen; don’t give out more praise, or the prince will start gushing about his love here.”
“That’s one part of it, but looking at you, haven’t your eyes started twinkling now, too?”
“Compared to Your Highness, we are just a bunch of unworthy peasants.”
“I seem to remember how you were surrounded by girls during the party.”
“Ah, that’s it! I wanted to ask you about this.”
“””Eh?”””
The three of them looked at me.
In all isekais, you can often see that there are a lot of ladies who swarm the prince, even if he already has a fiancee, but since I became one, everyone has stopped getting close to him.
It makes you ask, “Is it even legal?”
“Erm, I and Teal, during the social season, went to a lot of parties, but I haven’t seen even once him being accosted by other ladies there.”
“Ah…”
“About that…”
What’s the matter, aides? Why do you look so disappointed?
Don’t you go silent on me, bozos.
“Due to my girlish face, when compared to a lady, they will feel themselves inadequate and uncute; that’s why they’re all avoiding me.”
“Pfft.”
“Probably due to this, when we go to parties together, we get surrounded by women instead.”
“Ah. Well, you two are the prospective candidates for prime minister and military minister, respectively. Handsome and fine articles. Though Teal is my number one.”
“Good for you, Highness. A relationship of mutual love…”
“Sometimes, I am jealous of what you have, prince… Your face included.”
“I’m proud to have such a face, and if it’s to Miranda’s liking, that makes it even better for it.”
I and Teal both nodded at each other.
Now then. Let’s end the small talk at that and see what work is being done at this place immediately.
------------------ 
Chapter 56 – What kind of work are you doing?Greetings. Miranda speaking.
I am currently in the office Teal works in.
Drinking tea and playing the role of a good girl, I observe how they all work.
There is a veritable mountain of documents they have here.
Still, what kind of work can a ten-year-old prince be doing?
Wondering, I picked up a document from the pile of finished ones laying on the table to look through it.
“A request for the maintenance of the sidewalks in the Western Merchants’ District of the capital and the summary of budget estimates?”
“Ahh, those papers are the written requests, all concerning the management of the infrastructure of the castle town.”
Teal explained it to me.
There are many others, like the requests for maintenance of the main thoroughfare, the redevelopment of parts of the old town, and the servicing of both the water and sewage systems everyone is concerned with.
“Say, Teal, does your work all revolve around taking care of the castle town?”
“To be precise, it’s more like the work I am dealing with now is the management of the town that’s under direct control of the royal family.”
“Heeeh, like a lord’s work?”
“Yes, kind of.”
I see now. The king is responsible for the whole country, while Teal deals with the castle town.
As the kingdom’s population is around 2,000,000, managing them all is no small feat.
It was only a couple years ago that the building of the water and sewage systems started in the town area, and it’s still only halfway complete. In the town proper, there are quite a lot of paved roads, and as such, keeping them all nice and clean is an arduous task.
What’s more, looking through these documents, the majority of requests are about the management of the roads.
The capital is where most goods flow, and a large number of horse-drawn carriages carry heavy loads pressing on the stone pavement, which leads to wheel tracks left on the road that obstruct the traffic, or so I hear… Why not just go and lay the concrete on it? Wouldn’t it be better that way?
“Hey, Teal, this country has gypsium, isn’t it?”
“Hm? Yes, we have a supply of it. If memory serves, the place is in the territory of Marquess Saintgeorges.”
“Then, why don’t you pave the roads with concrete and make gutters the same and in the U-shape with standardized lids laying upon them?”
“What’s this you are talking about, Lady Miranda?”
Lord Earlgrey got interested.
Eh? I remember hearing that concrete was a recent development, though.
“The other day I heard about the discovery of the manufacturing process of concrete, so if you were to take water, gravel, and gypsum and mix it all in a cast, and as a result, you’d get a stone that’s a lot more sturdier than ordinary baked bricks.”
“Huh? I see, if you were to use that concrete, you could make quite many useful things with it.”
Hey, Teal, you’ve gotta stock up on this kinda stuff, eh?
“With our territory’s developed MIS, we can divide the production places, which will help us secure the required number of goods, so why don’t we take the implementation upon ourselves?”
“That’s a good idea. It would be worth trying to do this on the sideroads of the main road. Can I leave it to you, Miranda?”
“But I still don’t know the details concerning this recently developed concrete.”
“I, too, haven’t got any detailed information about it, but if we start collecting information right now, it will only be a waste of time, wouldn’t it?”
“What can I do with you? Let me lend a helping hand. Teal, do you have a proposal blank somewhere?”
“Yes, here you are. I’ve already prepared it.”
“That’s our Teal for ya! I didn’t know what I would have done otherwise.”
“It’s a thing that’s only used in places under my jurisdiction, though.”
“Spread it wider until we marry, okay?”
“I’ll try.”
I borrowed a pen and started to put together a production standard while drawing doodles for it.
While I’m at it, why don’t I use the stronger reinforced concrete, which’s easier to fix if it’s broken, and the ditches and their lids would also benefit from it? Are there such long metal rods here, though?
Can’t be helped. I’ll ask Father when I return to the mansion.
“I’ll draw up a more detailed plan after I consult with Father about it. There are quite a lot of things I don’t understand myself, as expected.”
“It’s okay. But to think that you already have concrete there.”
“I myself, too, only learned of it recently, so it’s still a new technology for me.”
Lords Earlgrey and Darjeen looked at me with incredulous faces.
What’s up, you both? You look like some otherworldly thing was shoved up your noggin.
“What are you two talking about? Explain so I can understand.”
“Lady Miranda, could it be that you understand how to use this blank form?”
I and Teal froze.
Due to having knowledge of the thing from our past lives, we instinctively got excited in our discussions, behaving like this new technology was no big deal, and left them both lost.
Nobody here would ordinarily understand what the U-shaped drain is.
With the blank, it’s the same. An ordinary noble lady who hasn’t been involved in government management would make heads or tails of it.
“Ohoho. As a betrothed of His Highness, I must serve the role of the one who helps develop the country by collecting the new technology from far and wide!”
“I, too, while having tea with Miranda, do often exchange information with her there, and the topic of the documents does appear frequently.”
Ahaha, ohoho.
We both could only dryly laugh.
Darn, that’s what you get for not paying attention. Continue to do this, and you’ll blabber something you can’t take back.
Well, what’s done is done. There’s no sense in worrying about it, so for now, let me just take the talks about all of that home and consult with Father.
------------------ 
Chapter 57 – A private birthday partyToday we are holding a private birthday tea party with Ladies Tolastina and Cascia, who came to our house.
The celebration proper was held at the palace.
It was very stuffy, so that’s why we decided to get together as friends and leisurely celebrate after that.
Among the children of our generation, I am the only one strangely different from others, having my birthday at the start of the spring, so with the pretext of watching flowers in the garden, we had our tea time granted.
A duke’s family’s home does have a splendid garden to match.
And Lady Tolastina has brought her betrothed with her here.
The son of a marquess, Rabble Simons.
A second son of the family that was renown for its military service in the navy. It seems he wants to become a navy officer in the future.
I wonder if Lady Tolastina is okay with it since, when he realizes his dream, he won’t be returning for a while, what with being out in the sea.
So anyway, with there being 3 girls, 1 boy will be quite nervous, so with the plea of “won’t someone call a gentleman or two?” from them, I had Teal make his appearance here.
“It’s all good and well, but why am I wearing a dress anyway?”
With Teal all dolled up in a fully closed green dress and a wig on his head, as a final finish-up, I asked Lisa to apply makeup to him.
Just one little misstep, and he could turn out prettier than even me…
“Is it to your liking? The dress, whose color is that of my eyes?”
“Miranda, don’t you have any shame?”
“What does this person say after being dressed up and having makeup applied without any protest?”
“Hm, to tell you the truth, it’s somewhat pleasant to have used cosmetics after all this time.”
“In the previous world, there were times when men used them; what difference does it make now?”
“I have a feeling it will only make my girly face more pronounced…”
“Don’t do it yourself; ask a maid to do it for you. You can just demand that it be done to emphasize your dignity instead.”
“Makes sense… I’ll take it into consideration.”
“I think that your current look is already good as-is, though~”
Talking of this and that, we went to the garden.
Everyone has already arrived there.
Oh, there’s a well-built-looking man here.
A handsome guy with light brown hair and an air of masculinity. I foresee him sporting a fierce look in the future.
Though, compared to other noble scions out there, Lord Rabble’s look is quite mob-like…
Lady Tolastina, on the other hand, has the air of a villainess, what with her flaming red hair falling in waves and her blue eyes.
She almost radiates her game characterness.
“Let me give my thanks for everyone gathered here today.”
“Happy birthday to you, Lady Miranda.”
“Let me congratulate you too, Lady Miranda, and here’s the person I wanted to introduce you to.”
“I also have someone I want you to meet.”
Well, I guess they already recognize that beauty standing behind me, tohugh.
As I didn’t bring the prince with me, Lord Rabble understandably stiffened.
I assume you are not experienced with girls. So cute.
“Then, I’ll start. This is my fiance, Rabble Simons.”
“It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Miranda. I am Rabble, the second son of Marquess Simons.”
“It is my pleasure to meet with you too, Lord Simons.”
Teal and I do an agreed-upon curtsey together.
Hey, Teal. Where the hell did you learn to make such a perfect curtsey?
“Now then, everyone. Can you keep what will occur now a secret?”
All present here looked at me, almost asking, “What secret will you share with us?”
Eh? Didn’t anyone realize?
After sharing a glance with Teal and getting his approval, I decided to come out straight.
“This person here is His Highness Dotteal Karpf Theria.”
“””What?”””
“You all can be at ease. It’s all because of Miranda’s ambition that I look like this.”
“Lady Miranda, aren’t you afraid of beheading for this?”
Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia were trembling.
Lord Rabble stood with his mouth hanging open. Close it, already.
“Prince, you are decidedly excited.”
“I, too, was pleasantly surprised to turn out to be such a refined lady. It’s a little fun.”
Lady Tolastina, hiding her face behind her folding fan, came to whisper to me.
“The nerve of you alone to get to indulge in every lady’s fantasy by yourself!!!”
“Fufufu. It’s a special show you can’t show to anyone but your close friends. Having the prince be my personal dress-up doll doubles the enjoyment, too.”
Separating, we shot a knowing smile at each other.
It’s quite surprising to find out that there’s a whole brigade of people eager to see the prince in drag.
When I start attending school, I’m thinking of forcing him to wear women’s clothing again during a cultural festival or such.
It’s so frustrating that we won’t be in the same year…
Teal himself seemed to quite enjoy talking with Lord Rabble in his current clothes, but how about the Simons guy himself?
He seems to be blushing a little, but, with the insides not being considered, he’s a guy, right? Are you alright there?
Didn’t you swear oaths with your betrothed, Lady Tolastina?
I can’t have you cheating on her here. Is it, though?
After getting presents from Ladies Tolastina and Cascia, we had our tea and went home.
Here’s hoping their mouths won’t become loose.
Well, since Teal has threatened them with his words, “You do understand, yes?” smiling, I guess they won’t babble to anyone.
How about our servants? They all gave me their tacit approval for my dangerous games.
My family doesn’t know, after all.
I get the feeling that those lurking in the shadows we employ do know of this, though…
------------------ 
Chapter 58 – A fashion leader? What’s that? Is it tasty?My proposed plan about concrete I basically threw into my father’s hands.
The only other contribution was in the form of a written proposal I sent to Teal.
As for what will be after, well, good luck to all of them.
Considering the whole story about the existence and development of the concrete I heard from Father, my words, “Please use everything to your satisfaction,” were received by him without resistance.
As far as I heard, the whole operation and furthering of the development were to be handled by Brother Tosted and Marquess Saintgeorges.
I believe in you, so make that reinforced concrete a reality.
Okay, so, with the knowledge of gypsum being used here, my interest in the mineral resources sparked, and I am now trying to find out more about the ores the country has at its disposal.
If you want to ask me why, then I’d like to have healing crystals.
And I want to find bismuth.
That crystal is so cool and beautiful; I like it very much.
If you melt it on the gas stove and pull at the sides, you’d get a lengthened crystal with a rectangular shape shining the colors of the rainbow.
You can construct very stylish necklaces or earrings with it.
Each and every crystal will be one-of-a-kind, which you can make yourself, and it makes it an easy stone to work with even in modern times.
It’s just that I know only of the existence of the bismuth crystals but do not know how they form or from what ore they come from.
It would be great if I could find them…
Now, in this world, a woman’s underwear is a corset and drawers.
With that, trying to wear a serious dress is suffocating.
Since I’m still a child and don’t usually wear anything more than a simple dress, I haven’t yet tried to wear clothes that fully squeeze your waist to fit.
Though, due to Lady Tolastina’s apparent healthy physical growth, which made some of her features somewhat prominent, every time she comes for tea, she complains to me about the difficulties of wearing the stuffy corset she has started using recently.
My being a nine-year-old plays a role in it, so the low height and flatness are to be expected for me.
Lady Tolastina is almost a head bigger than me already. Growth spurts are scary.
What will it be like in the future? More femininity or androgynousness?
Lady Cascia, too, has experienced growth in her chest recently.
How envying… They are all starting to grow into women.
I think that a stylish dress will wonderfully complement their apparent femininity. Still, I am quite envious.
But I think trying to be refined is no simple task.
We, especially, being the poster girls of our respective factions, are fashion leaders in a sense, so we can’t dress badly.
I already consult and partake in the latest fashion talk with Miss Rui, and thanks to the Goth Miranda shop, I turn out to be quite an outlandish style setter for the clothing already…
Though I won’t ever wear those myself.
Were I to try, I’d legit become a doll in everyone’s eye.
I do not wish such a thing upon myself. My sense of reality will erode.
I can permit Teal to do this to me, though.
“As such, this time, what do you think about this kind of design I have?”
“Uhm, let’s see.”
I have called Miss Rui to see me and asked her to make a couple dresses to wear the next month.
Recently, it has become quite popular to add to clothes a lot of ribbons, frills, and other things for extra lavishness.
“It’s kinda, uhh. Has become very close to the designs used for Goth Miranda these days. Differently colored, though.”
“That’s right; you can’t deny the influence.”
Damn, due to my bringing forth a weird concept, all young ladies took to it quite thoroughly, so my dreams of a simple dress were shattered beyond belief.
“I myself am quite partial to a simpler design, with a smattering of embroidery to accentuate…”
“Lady Miranda, are you familiar with the phrase “reap what you sow?””
“It’s as you say, Miss Rui.”
“Fufufu.”
I’ll have you remember that I’m a duke’s daughter!
Well, whatever. We are already this close; I’ll let it slide.
“By the way, Lady Miranda. Are you aware that the prices for cotton fabrics went down with the recent opening of the spinning mills and textile factories in the county?”
“I heard of it. There, it has a production volume dozens of times that of the usual hand weaving.”
“Right, so thanks to this, it’s become possible to get your hands on a cloth of uniform make. This is a primary cause of the increase in ribbons and frills added as decorations to clothes.”
Ah, so the materials’ volume per coin has increased… As such, the nobles, who like to impress others with luxury, have started to take advantage of that increased volume.
In that case, why won’t you spend your money elsewhere?
But I guess that it’s not possible to dress in the same things that commoners wear.
“Miss Rui, why don’t we spend some money on dyeing?”
“Dyeing, you say? Do you mean those beautiful colors like blue and green that stir your desire to have them? That august dress you created the other day did have the coloring similar to that of your eyes, but without any luster, just a dulled green hue, and I would have liked to have one with more of a shine, I admit.”
True, even if it doesn’t take that much money, if at all, the dress Teal wore, the color of my eyes, was of a muted green, which, while I’d like to say was made with great effort, didn’t require so.
“Then, let’s try to develop some techniques with the money we have, okay? Even a simple dress, depending on the coloring, could turn out to have an air of luxury.”
“I see. Yes, you can’t really do more improvements on the cloth itself…”
“If there’s nothing, just make it yourself, I say!”
“I’ll consult with the wholesaler later.”
“I request of you that you try and make a cloth that’s as close as possible to the brilliance of my eyes.”
“Understood. I take it you are satisfied with the design itself, then?”
“Ah, no! Wait just a second.”
Saying so, I took out the sketchbook where I have compiled drawings of dress designs.
“Using this, even with the large volume of cloth used, it still looks simple, no?”
“I am astounded as to your skills.”
“This time, I made use of a triangle as a motif.”
“Such a novelty wouldn’t have come to me even in a thousand years… So vexing.”
Of course, since I took inspiration from the mineral crystals I am into these days.
It can’t be helped for Miss Rui since the design I presented is of a futuristic dress, unlike the traditional dress we made before.
If the current trend is to use an abundance of fabric, I’ll turn the tables on this, so to speak.
Now it occurred to me that I hadn’t seen the use of a technique for adding jewels to the dresses themselves.
Well, maybe there are people who do use cheap stones or something out there.
------------------ 
Chapter 59 – The last lesson for regular magicMy magic studies have come to a climax.
With the conclusion of daily magic teachings, today, as the last regular magic I’ll learn for now, will be the defense magic you can use regardless of your attributes.
It’s a very important magic used for self-defense.
The magic itself appears and serves as a physical wall, which, if you’ve practiced it enough, could block a knight’s sword.
Still, the strength of it fluctuates depending on the mana and control of the caster; it can break after one stroke of a sword or disappear from an overwhelming magical strike.
This magic is quite showy, since its breaking is signified by the sound of glass shattering when it disperses under the physical strike impact.
I know it; my brothers were kind enough to demonstrate during a bout.
Moreover, Teal was very proficient in its use.
He said it would be alright even if he was struck by a ship of the line’s cannon.
Did he test it already?
“Then, deploy the magic as you were taught.”
Under grandpa-teacher’s urging, I tried to use the barrier.
Ah, just so you know, I don’t need to use an incantation.
I was able to master chantless magic during my daily magic study.
Your imagination is paramount.
Putting up my arms before me, I tried to deploy the magic as was instructed.
The scenery right before me became distorted.
Grandpa-teacher narrowed his eyes. Whazzap?
“As I thought, my lady does have talent in magic.”
“Truly? I am just doing exactly as I was taught.”
“Your wall is quite thick. Almost makes me think that’s not your first time trying to use it.”
Looking at how he circled me, I could infer that the size of the wall was around 140 cm in height and 200 mm in thickness, based on the distortions.
The barrier forces the light to bend, so despite the transparency of the magic, you could see that something exists here.
With such great thickness, I bet it can withstand a cannon strike.
I wonder if I deploy the wall slightly slanted, could it ricochet?
The grandpa-teacher thumped on the barrier a couple times.
“Not only thickness, but the intesity is also a thing to behold.”
Hm, let’s see… scree, scree
“M, my lady?”
With the barrier still in use, I tried to move forward a bit.
The old man stopped me.
“Ah, I just wanted to see if I could move with the thing deployed, is all.”
“Quite an interesting idea you have. While it’s not impossible to do so, I haven’t seen a lot of people using it in this way.”
“It is used as a shield, no?”
“Yes, that’s right. But if you exceed the limit of its strength, it’ll break, so the knights equip themselves with a physical shield.”
I see. That’s one mystery solved.
Defense magic does have noticeable variations depending on its user; that’s true.
I seem to remember that Lisa once said to me that the maximum thickness of her magic wouldn’t be more than 100 mm.
That said, I’d really like to measure the maximum possible sturdiness of the wall. Like the tensile strength and breaking point.
Considering Teal’s magic, which is around 150 mm, can withstand a cannonball shot at it, you can think of it as similar to an iron plate.
Hm?
If I can already deploy such a bulky and hardy wall, won’t it be possible to destroy things by using two walls and sandwiching something between them?
“Teacher, I want to try something.”
“What’s the matter? I think that you’ve mastered defense magic as of now. What do you want to try?”
I borrowed a potted plant that nobody would miss breaking and placed it on the floor.
“Heiyaaa!”
After deploying the wall on both sides of the pot, I tried to smash it.
With a little more pressure, the thing finally starts cracking and is finally crushed flat.
Fufufu. That’s how you use defense magic to attack, bitch!
Eh? Grandpa-teacher’s expression suddenly turned grim.
“My lady, please don’t try to use the magic like this before other people…”
“Why is that? What if I’m attacked? Wouldn’t I be able to apprehend a criminal this way?”
“I beseech you not to use the defense magic as an attacking tool! I will not be able to teach children anymore!”
Ah, so it’s like that.
I wonder if there’s some rule for it, seeing that he never taught me any potentially lethal magic.
“Could it be that the country decided that “underage people cannot be permitted to use attack magic”?”
“Perish the thought. It’s simply that normally it’s not possible for the magic to have that kind of strength, so no one uses it like this. But I think only aristocrats would be able to use it in this way.”
“Then, it’s alright to use in dire circumstances?”
“I beg of you, do not use it to attack until you become an adult.”
Such was a plea to me from grandpa-teacher, heh.
If I use it smartly, I could “squish” any would-be attackers in one go, though…
But, since the wall is transparent, with poor control, I would see all manner of things… I dislike all things gorey, so I guess I’ll refrain… Let’s seal this skill until the time comes.
------------------ 
Chapter 60 – Days flow byMiranda, who sealed her barrier wall magic only to be used as a defense, greets you.
The other day, when I went to the kitchen to request sweets for tea, I found a black demon and, using that protection reflexively, smushed them into a paste. Feeling regret, I decided to seal that magic for real.
Of course, I screamed out loud.
Nah, the more likely explanation is that I just lost my words after smashing that thing.
Now, judging by what I learned in the last lesson and taking into account that each person has their own attribute, I can surmise that my attribute is most probably Wind.
Grandpa-teacher, as it turned out, was one who, by observing the magic waves emitted by a person, could discern their attributes.
In addition, there seem to exist tools serving a similar purpose in discovering attributes and mana capacity, known as magic tools.
This is the first time I’m hearing this, bro.
After asking around in our home, I discovered that the thing was surprisingly close.
Since I don’t boil water myself, it stands to reason that I wouldn’t know of its existence. A thermos bottle.
Also, as I haven’t bothered to think about it deeply, the lights in the rooms were magic tools, too. Geh.
If I think about it now, I don’t remember lighting any candles.
In addition, the nights are bright.
Maybe it’s because I reincarnated, but now I feel a sense of defeat for not having any doubts about all that.
Just try it yourself, living with only candles to brighten the night, and you’ll see… See nothing before you, heh.
Our Mirandiehl family is proficient in the use of Wind magic.
For Arkray, it’s Water, and for Karpf Tetra, it’s Fire.
Teal’s attribute is Fire. Truly, his mother’s blood is strong in him.
It feels like we will both be throwing love-filled, explosive fists at someone.
Fire magic and Wind magic complement each other.
Though I still don’t know how to use it.
Everything in attribute magic can be directly linked to attack magic, which is taught at the school.
Despite being a school for nobility, it’s close to that of a school of magic, where even the commoner children with a large amount of mana can be enrolled.
There are even those who are called “attributeless.”
Those kids are very important for the creation of the magic tools, as if a person with an attribute were to try the same, they would make a tool that’s only usable by those who have the same attribute as the creator.
The vast majority of the attributeless are commoners, and only some of them are from the nobility.
That’s why it’s quite common for a noble to take in a kid who, in addition to not having an attribute, also has a large amount of mana.
When I asked Father, he said that we, too, have some exclusive toolmakers employed.
They mostly help Brother Tosted with the development of the territory, so I haven’t seen them at the capital.
It would not be a stretch to call the magic tools household appliances.
They can help with boiling water or lighting your home.
Despite this world having them, I heard that a steam engine was developed here some time ago.
Combining it with the magic tools, they were able to achieve torque.
It has started to be supplied for use together with the previously developed spinning machines that work using water power.
I heard that they have started to be introduced in our territory.
Hmm, Industrial Revolution.
By the way, I recall that the French Revolution happened around this time.
Could it be that the soul of little Miranda was stuck in a loop due to similar things happening?
As far as I heard from Teal, Father, and Brother, the towns are tranquil, and the relations between nobles and commoners are cordial.
The country has established the limit to the taxes a noble can impose on his subjects; the Mirandiehl and Karpf Tetra families are pro-democracy; and, starting from the capital, the citizens’ assemblies have started gaining rights for self-governance.
It also doesn’t feel like a rebellion or people’s revolution will occur soon.
At any rate, during Teal’s birthday celebration, I had a chance to speak with the people of the capital assembly, and I haven’t felt any signs of animosity.
They did have some apprehension towards the Arkray faction, but towards the currently reigning royal family, which thinks about its subjects, they expressed their willingness to work together.
There were also discussions about transitioning to the constitutional monarchy system in the future, so I’d like everyone to continue getting along.
Hey, maybe it’s all because of my and Teal’s reincarating here, eh?
There are no signs of revolution brewing, and relations with neighboring countries are normal.
I don’t see how I could be condemned now, and nobody seems to be targeting my life either.
There’s no sense in worrying about what-ifs, so I’ll continue living my fulfilling life for now.
By the way, the concrete pavement and reinforced concrete development were a success!
We have already completed covering the rotary to our mansion with concrete.
From the start, the horse-drawn carriages did have leaf suspension, and even if the road was a little bad, the comfyness wasn’t really compromised before, but now, thanks to the paved roads, the sounds during riding have become quite silent.
On the unpaved and cobblestone roads, it does rattle and clatter.
Also, the other day, I saw some cat paw footprints.
Such is the destiny of concrete pavement.
------------------ 
Chapter 61 – O, Teal. I pray it was a joke?The social season has come.
This year, I won’t have to host a tea party! Hooray!
Instead, I started clinging to Teal more and more.
He himself is still not at the age where he could attend an evening party, so my clinging to him is no problem.
But I’m mightily annoyed by him preparing me a new dress every time he invites me to tea or dinner, ya know?
Well, I get that, as a prince’s bethroted and a duke’s daughter to boot, I cannot use the same clothes over and over again.
Even so, Teal. Would you kindly stop using me as a dress-up doll for your own amusement and mood-lifting already?
With his self-assured words, “I have such a cute fiancee; it’s my duty to make her shine,” already 20 dresses came into my possession.
There are even perfect “lolita dress” ones among them.
Damn, I’ll get my revenge for this someday…
With that said, now I hugged Teal, who came riding in a carriage.
Quite strong… Hm?
“You are cute today, too, Miranda…”
“…”
“What’s the matter?”
Teal, are you not aware? Or want to hide it? It’s obvious to all, though.
“Let’s talk in the carriage.”
Escorted by Teal, I boarded it~ Man, royal carriages aren’t shaking at all.
It seems that suspension continues to evolve.
The road straight to the castle is now paved with concrete, so you can talk inside without having to shout.
Okay.
“Teal. I’m glad to be hugged as a greeting, but I’d like to point out that it was a little dishonorable of you. I felt it poking.”
“Sorry… I tried to be mindful of it… It just turned out like this when I imagined you wearing a dress I sent you, so yeah.”
His explaining this while being red as a tomato makes me squeal in delight.
That’s not the issue right now!
“Do you understand men’s suffering now?”
“Uh, sorry, I guess.”
Still remember when you reproved me for the morning wood in our past lives, eh?
“Hey, did you have spermarche already?”
“Miranda.”
“Purely academic interest. I need to confirm the prince’s growth.”
“Yeah…”
“Well, you are at this age; it’s understandable. By Japanese standard, you are already twelve.”
It’s a very sensitive age, after all.
Just seeing a lightly dressed person of the opposite sex will make you involuntarily react.
“Did your family not impart to you the knowledge?”
“Knowledge of what?”
“Fapping.”
“Bwha!”
The hell? Do they really not teach kids this?
In my opinion, it’s very important for men.
“As you often need to appear at formal events, I recommend you learn how to properly control it yourself.”
Saying this, I imitate the motion with my right hand.
“Stop with that hand. But I understand?”
“Also, for the future children’s sake, it’s better to relieve what needs to be relieved, so keep it in mind.”
“Yeah.”
Teal has gone all meek on me there.
Well, I know it’s embarrassing, but I’m your sempai in these matters.
It’s not good to let it all accumulate.
After staying silent for some time, Teal turned to me as if he remembered something.
“Miranda, and you, did you have your first blood yet?”
“…”
Ahh, now if I think about it, he has experience being a girl, huh…
“Not… yet.”
“Hm. There are individual differences, but it’s still quite bothersome.”
“It’s not a thing you can get without experiencing it.”
“When you will have an opportunity, ask Lady Miran or your maid Lisa about it. You hear me? And wait, are there sanitary products for women in this country, I wonder?”
Teal has started mumbling something; are you okay there?
I’ll consult with Mother or Lisa later.
I do recall that Lisa takes three consecutive days’ absence leave a month; it’s probably due to that, though I dunno about Mother… I don’t think the menopause is getting close to her, though.
What am I to do?
By the way, since that day, Teal, when hugging me, has stopped having those accidents, so I think he listened to my advice.
It’s good that I was able to impart my knowledge.
Yep, yep.
------------------ 
Chapter 62 – Argh, I don’t understand anythingI’m now ten!
The others are at the age when they will enroll in the school for nobles.
It’s a shame that I won’t be able to play with them as before.
So okay, with my interest piqued after hearing about it from Teal, I asked Mother how menstruations are handled in this world, but she dodged the question, saying, “When the time comes, okay?”
Due to this, even Lisa has betrayed me.
She said, “Madam prohibited me from speaking about it.”
Fuck it all! Now I’m really worried about myself, ya know?
I do remember how, in our past lives, Teal had always been really pissed and annoyed right before that time of the month.
While I let the sleeping dogs lie for now, I decided to help develop sanpro for the poor women, though it brought back the memories of my realizing how ignorant I was about these matters after seeing a movie where it was said, “Were I a man, this amount of blood would’ve killed me,” and how troublesome it is to start having PMS.
With no other option left, I planned to call to a tea party Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia, who are preparing to go to the school to talk to them.
“So, have you both started having it?”
Lady Cascia, who was watching how Lady Tolastina drowns in the mountain of plushies with a pleasant smile, froze midway through bringing the teacup to drink from after hearing my question.
“”What?””
Was I a little too straightforward?
Could it be that in this world, too, this topic is taboo and you don’t mention it in polite company?
“Er, Lady Miranda. What do you mean?”
“Ah, err, you know, that monthly thing, yeah.”
“Oh, so that’s what you meant.”
It seems Lady Tolastina understood me.
Lady Cascia, on the other hand, still has a look of confusion on her face.
“Lady Miranda, where did you hear about it? Usually, when the time comes, your mother or exclusive maid should teach you about it.”
Ah, I see.
Does that mean Mother was surprised that I heard it somewhere, too?
“Mine started last year; I was quite surprised then… You know, when I saw blood on my underwear, I worried that I got sick.”
Lady Tolastina’s growth is envious; her looks are to die for; and her breasts are big. Are you really twelve?
With this in mind, you can be assured that her female hormone secretion is going well.
Wait. But that shouldn’t depend on one’s physique, no?
“What are you two talking about?”
Asked Lady Cascia, tilting her head in wonder.
“Ah.”
“Well.”
Now, thinking about it, there weren’t any health-related lessons in the noble’s education curriculum.
Eh? Is it alright for the prince’s betrothed to not know all this, though?
Well, even without studying it, I do have some knowledge.
“Lady Cascia, when the time comes, your family should talk to you about it as well.”
Thank God for Lady Tolastina’s backup throw.
Thanks.
Hmm, I wonder how it is for her to go through it.
How strong are her pains and such?
I want to ask, but I can’t just do it here…
As if noticing my questioning look, Lady Tolastina came out of the plushies’ mountain and whispered in my ear.
“You see, it’s very difficult for me, as they are irregular. They can strike at any time. It’s good that I was at home when it happened.”
Hm? Ain’t it bad?
Are you alright, Lady Tolastina?
You don’t eat a strange diet or something? Probably not, if I think about it.
“Lady Tolastina, are you restricting your food intake, perchance?”
“It is embarrasing to admit, but yes, I do, as I get weight quite easily, so as to not lose my figure, I abstain from eating a lot…”
“You mustn’t! If you don’t eat properly, your cycle won’t stabilize. I heard.”
To tell you the truth, that’s the extent of my knowledge about this topic.
It would be good if there was a female doctor here… I haven’t heard about them.
Overwhelming yourself with a diet from a young age is really dangerous for you, and I need to spread this information as soon as possible. No?
Despite the dicey start of the tea party, both of them asked me not to worry about it too much.
You know, I got worried about you, though.
I’ll ask Teal later, then…
------------------ 
Chapter 63 – The queen’s education has come to a close for nowOkay, it’s finished!
It’s good that I don’t need to go to the castle from now on.
The next time it starts again will be after I graduate from the academy.
Though, seeing that I have finished learning the country’s history and there won’t be any more dance or manners lessons after graduation, will they be teaching me those? The bedroom pleasures, yes? I just know it!
What a disappointing ten-year-old with a lot of superficial knowledge of sex I am.
Hmm? I’m still underage; I get that, but I still haven’t experienced arousal yet.
Is it alright? I didn’t get into that kind of mood when hugging Teal.
By the way, as the closing part of the queen’s education, I was taught about special products from each territory.
As part of the Queen’s duty, when talking with foreign VIPs, I’d need to try to promote my country’s products, so it’s a very important study.
Thanks to this, I have finally found quite a lot of the stones I looked for.
Like healing crystals and birthstones.
It’s just that, in this world, there wasn’t any meaning in those birthstones.
You still have the culture of noting birthdays here, though? Why won’t I try and sell the accessories with these stones embedded into them, if so?
And so, after consulting with Mother, asking our craftsman Barth, and leaving it to the jeweler, I was able to work out the birthday stones as close as I remembered them, with the places I couldn’t being conformed to the design as a whole.
I will gift one to Mother later!
“I thank you for giving me a minute of your valuable time, Mother.”
“If it is Miranda asking, I will have time whenever you ask.”
When I asked her for a meeting, she really did make time for me the next day.
Well, usually Mother, being the wife of a high-ranking aristocrat, always gets invited to various great nobles’ tea and night parties, so I thought she was busy, but it turned out that she’s not.
Eh, since she’s mistress of the mansion, her role is to manage its operation.
Father, too, isn’t at home due to work.
“You see, I have an idea for new jewelry, and I wondered, can’t I expand the market with it?”
Saying so, I took out a sample necklace with my mother’s birthday stone and 12 other different types of the birthday stones we all chose.
“This is the necklace with Mother’s birthday stone made as a sample and 12 types of gems for each month. Depending on the article, it can be cheap jewelry, but it can still catch one’s eye if you gift it to someone on their birthday.”
“I see, it is not that big of a gem.”
“Yes, I have prepared here the sizes an affluent commoner can afford, the big ones for the nobility to use, and also some smaller ones that are elaborately worked on, which makes them somewhat pricy.”
“I see, quite a wide selection you have here.”
“Yes, with this, we can establish a new business, which will use the gems that, while being produced domestically, weren’t used for anything due to size concerns, and now that they will be utilized for gifting, as such, we will efficiently use all the gems and mineral resources we have.”
Mother nodded to me, seemingly impressed.
I see it’s been seen in a favorable light.
“Then, let us announce them immediately at the next tea party, and if we add to them meanings, like the flowers’ language, it will surely sell.”
“This I entrust to you, Mother. I still haven’t fully grasped the flowers’ meanings, and I didn’t even think about doing so.”
“You can count on me with this.”
Okay! I threw all responsibility onto Mother!
With birthday stones, I can get quite a lot of money, so the next time I want to prepare stone polishing equipment for myself.
------------------ 
Chapter 64 – Polishing stones is funSince becoming the jeweler’s business partner, I’ve started getting the rejected stones from among the mined ores.
And so I bought a polisher.
That is, a whetstone and abradant. There wasn’t any sandpaper, okay?
To use it, you cover a piece of cloth with the compound and polish stones.
Well, no wonder. The resin adhesive doesn’t exist, so no sandpaper for you.
With that said, I decided to just roll with it and go polishing.
I wanna make a handmade accessory!
After the reproduction in the form of a dollhouse of the ducal house was finished, I now have free time and have appreciation shows with dolls left sitting in there.
When I wanted to find another type of fun, I came up with making an accessory.
In my previous life, I wasn’t able to.
Since this is a hobby that requires a lot of time, with my work schedule, I didn’t have time to indulge in it.
As such, I just slowly built my collection of plastic models.
But now, with the queen’s education and magic lessons coming to an end, in the next two years before entering the school, I am “free!”
All the social duties can be completed by going out with Teal, so for me, who is the most basic of the hikikomoris, there’s no better way to waste time than to indulge in time-consuming hobbies!
That’s why I am now polishing a stone.
You can’t expect a perfect diamond cut from me, so for now I will satisfy myself by making them into beautiful elliptic shapes.
Was this stone called a blue topaz?
I got it after all the thickly blue parts were taken, and the rejected light blue parts were left for me to take.
See, it’s good after you polish it, eh? A transparent aqua-colored stone get!
I’m gonna make it into a necklace as is.
This polished stone I will give to the craftsman, Barth, to work with later.
For an accessory for general use, it’s quite alright, I guess. For parties and the like, it’s a no-no, though.
And I got a rare visit from Teal.
“Miranda, aren’t you putting your faith into strange things?”
The first thing coming out of his mouth when we sat for tea in the parlor was this.
“What the hell are you on about?”
“After hearing stories about how you started collecting ores and minerals, I immediately thought that you were plotting something again.”
“Ahh, hm. I’m planning to start selling birthday stones together with Mother.”
“So that’s why… Recently, the prices of these things have started to rise.”
Is that it? Because our Mirandiehl family has started to be more interested in things that we ignored before, like these ores, he now thinks that, huh?
“Are there any problems with this?”
“No, I just want to, while I can, create a futures contract regulation system. Depending on the commodity, we export things overseas, so while it’s good that the prices are rising, do it in moderation.”
“I see. If a crash occurs, the nobles will literally fly in our faces.”
“You also can’t forget that it can have an effect on the common citizens, too.”
Yep, yep. Even in the previous world, the futures for oil or steel products were reported in the news about how general investors lost all their capital on rising and falling prices regardless of the conditions on the market.
I don’t know the details, though.
“This I will leave to you, Teal. It’s not in my expertise.”
“Who could have thought that the knowledge from the past life would prove useful here?”
“You were working in a bank, I recall.”
“I was working as a teller for trust investment-related things.”
“Oh, that’s right.”
I was an engineer, so I’m not versed in that stuff.
Well, fight on, Teal.
“You’re still so carefree, I see.”
“Of course I am. So, how’s school?”
“A bore, since the lessons are all about revising.”
“Is it due to the prince’s education?”
“I am sure.”
“Then the same awaits me, I guess.”
Teal nodded.
Well, the main purpose of the nobles’ academy is to master magic control and networking, last I heard, so they take notes on these things.
I feel like there’s still a lot of time and opportunities to laze around. Not bad at all.
------------------ 
Chapter 65 – Our first group work?Today, Teal visited us in the morning.
It’s quite hard on him to be able to visit only on days when the school is closed.
Upon arriving, we hugged and went straight to the guest room.
Hm? Teal, why did you make others vacate the room?
“I want to consult with you about something.”
Teal asked me with a strange expression on his face.
What ails you so much? Did you find a person you fell in love with in school and now want to break the engagement?
“To tell you the truth, the girls always get a break for 2-3 days once a month. I want you to do something with it.”
A lightbulb came up over my head at that.
Is this it? The you-know-what?
“Err, do they take breaks for their periods?”
“Ah, yes, that’s what I think. There are those who don’t take days off, but their number is small. The problem is, there isn’t a doctor who could help with all that.”
“As I thought… I did feel like I noticed something wrong.”
I looked up at the sky.
The midwives do exist, but an obstetrician-gynecologist? Dream on.
In addition, the notion of a female doctor itself is nonexistent.
In some types of work, like dressmaking, women are quite active, but most of the workers are men, and that has not painted a great picture in my mind until now.
“Teal, could it be that due to that unique female problem, women cannot socially progress here?”
“Looking from our past lives’ standpoint, this is worse than even modern Japan.”
“Even if in this world this view is normal, I, too, want to do something to change it.”
Here, probably due to the mindset of male superiority, modest and proper women are preferred, and marriage is considered a girl’s happiness in life.
The usual pattern after marriage is to birth children and protect the home, so even the female knights are forced to retire after that.
If the already small number of them is made to leave, it’s impossible to gather an adequate number of guards for female royals out of them.
For most noble women, be it for marriage or finding a partner, going to work as maids is commonplace.
Moving up in the world isn’t on their minds in the first place.
“Hmm… for those with really hard symptoms, even 2-3 days won’t be enough, so doesn’t it affect their education?”
“It does, I think. When you look at the yearly school rankings, there’s only a handful of girls at the top throughout the whole history of it.”
“It seems I underestimated the scope of the problem caused by the absence of sanpro in this world.”
“And so, I want your help, Miranda.”
“I’m not a student yet, though.”
“Wouldn’t it be good to resolve the problem beforehand?”
“True.”
And like that, we both decided to start the development of sanitary products and expand gynecology.
For starters, we went to investigate the now-existing painkillers, sanitary pads, and the like.
At the very least, I haven’t seen disposable pantiliners. Sneaky-sneaky at the washhouse I will check.
This is important for my future, you know? I can’t leave this unchecked, you understand?
“By the way, Teal. Is it alright for you, as the prince, to get involved in all this?”
“Hm, if this is taboo or not… I cannot say. Still, wouldn’t it be good for my knowledge to be useful for all women in this world, especially you, Miranda?”
“How chivalrous of you… I’m gonna fall for you.”
“Fall all you like.”
Damn, his smile is so cool.
Just by becoming a man and being freed from being taken lightly by men from his previous life who said, “You’re just a woman,” he has recently started to enjoy his work and school life.
Still, the ex-female sense helps him notice problems students in the school are having, and I can’t do anything but commend him for that.
I’ve gotta try and expand my own horizons…
------------------ 
Chapter 66 – Gynecologist, come!Sup, Miranda greets you.
Our agreement with Teal—that is, for my and other women’s easier future lives, the thought of creating the so-called maternity and gynecology science of the modern times here—is now being studied through my literature perusal.
In just under one month, I have come to know the shockingly unpleasant truth.
The result of my findings is the utter nonexistence of such a thing.
In Japan, it falls under the complex category of obstetrics and gynecology, but now I just want to have a “gynecologist.”
Though it seems that there are no doctors who try to do research in this field.
In addition, the only doctors in this country are men.
No, even in today’s Japan, more than half of the personnel for this department consisted of them, so I probably aim too high.
It’s just that in the kingdom, the only time you’d show your skin to a member of the opposite sex is when the time comes to do the deed; as such, it’s unthinkable for women to spread their legs before a male doctor.
Then the only way out of this is to raise female doctors, and it won’t be a fast process at all.
Moreover, the standards for being a doctor are very ambiguous.
The makers of folk remedies are considered doctors, and even witch doctors still exist.
Teal, maybe we should start with the healthcare revolution?
“With that said, I thought about revolutionizing the medical field first.”
“My father is busy with this now. And I try to shove gynecology into practices.”
“Geh. As I thought, the real masters have already thought of everything.”
“Ah, no, you see… This is all thanks to you, Miranda.”
“What did I do?”
I haven’t heard anything about this.
“Remember how you said that at five you had a high fever and was confined to bed? After that, with you losing memories, the person who boasted of being the doctor working in the palace who was responsible for inspecting your illness was judged a quack and thrown out of his position. The prime minister, that is, the Mirandiehl duke, has said that we need to develop standards for people aiming to be doctors… And here we are.”
Ah, I understand it now.
If I recall, at that time I had a vague idea of how Father, shouting about a quick doctor, flew out somewhere in rage.
So that’s why he’s had his hand in the medical field’s upheaval.
“Already, the internists need to have qualifications; the pharmacists are being registered; the sights are set on surgeons; and the scope continues to expand.”
“Now you try to push for gynecology.”
“Right.”
That’s quite unexpected from you, Teal.
To have them listen to your suggestions so eagerly.
“By the way. What do you think of the fact that in this country there are no female doctors?”
“Hmm. Strictly speaking, it’s a little different from that.”
Tilting his head with a puzzled expression on his face, Teal said this to me.
What do you mean, strictly speaking? Do you count midwives in this?
“In truth, the female alchemists and daughters or wives of doctors do try and aid with medical treatment practices.”
“Not like a nurse helping?”
“Er, no, they do the same work as doctors. You know, unmarried women can’t show their naked bodies to a man, right? The nobles especially.”
“Ah, I see. That kinda help.”
“Yeah, so with those practices, those who have become well versed in the ailments unique to women have started to appear.”
“If they started to appear, that means you have already investigated it?”
“Yep.”
“You’re so fast at doing this kinda thing…”
Hey, Teal, stop facing me with that shining face of yours.
It’s so divine, I can’t look at it directly.
“So, with Miranda’s help, I’m thinking of establishing the obstetrics and gynecology department.”
“What could I help you with? I’m feeling left out, as I don’t know what to do.”
“Lend me the place and the body.”
“Lol.”
What d’ya mean, lend me your body? Wanna do a human experiment?
“I’ve already contacted a couple of people, and I got a positive reaction from those female medical workers, and, with your backing, I feel the development will be progressing more rapidly.”
“If you’re fine with it, I can lend you as many places as I can, for which I need to consult with Father, but what do you mean about the body?”
“I need people to be test subjects for pankillers and a new type of sanitary napkin.”
“Hey, hold your horses, fiancé.”
“About that, this is only when you really start having those, though.”
“Of course! I am still a little kid.”
“Until then, the researchers will use each other as test subjects, and in two years’ time, there should be some results that will be presented to you to check, am I right?”
“And by announcing that I use them, the whole country will know of this, and even the neighboring ones could be interested in importing those products, yes?”
“That’s right.”
You’re such a sly fox, Teal.
Truly, in this area, I have had no chance of beating him from the start… So frustrating, man!
------------------ 
Chapter 67 – Detached building, get.“So you see, Father. For the advancement of medical care, I want to borrow one of the rooms of our own home.”
“In that case, why won’t we just build a separate building in the garden, then?”
Hello, the surprised mess called Miranda, who, when she vividly explained to her father the necessity of the female health care advancement that will be advantageous to her health and tried to secure a place for it, received an answer so out of left field that she was astonished, greets you.
That’s why, in two months’ time, a detached two-story building would be built at the specified location.
Its layout was that of a place you could get into from outside without going through the mansion, as it was possible to add an entrance different from the rear exit of the duke’s home.
I tried my utmost to plan the floors so as to be usable as the gynecology department’s place at the very least.
I’m very good at this kind of thing.
Teal, on the other hand, can’t draw for shit.
So, after being told to do as I please, I added to the drawing my personal room on the second floor in addition to a conference room.
I felt that, in due time, it would be used as a director’s room, where I have transferred all the plushies that filled my room to the brim here.
Now almost half of my room is buried in stuffed toys, and, taking into account the prototype nui with the monster toys based off of those from picture books… Their number is so great that I don’t wanna even count them.
So without further ado, the construction has started.
It should be completed a little before Teal’s birthday month, I think.
The entrance is different from my house, so it’s easier to call my friends there.
Let it be a place where we drop all aristocratic obligations and pretenses and just have fun.
While we’re at it, let’s donate the plushies to a hospital or two.
When I said as much to Teal, it was decided that we would meet at a later time.
He has already reached out to a number of women experienced in medical care. Good.
An alchemist, the daughter and wife of the palace’s doctor, oh, and a female pharmacist.
With me added, we’ve got a five-person team with Teal as manager, and the whole project has been put to life.
It’s turned into something grand now. Is it all right, though?
And then the construction work started, but… It reminded me of something.
The soil was dug out, wooden frames were built, steel rods were rapidly put here and there, and mixed concrete was poured.
Ain’t it a reinforced concrete building structure, this one!!!
Wait a minute. I did know about concrete paving and the existence of reinforced concrete, but I haven’t heard that they can use it in building houses, though?!
“Father, is it possible to use this type of concrete to construct structures?”
“Ah, taking your proposal into account, the scholars were inspired to make use of it in construction, you see. I thought of using this occasion as an experiment to use this material in building this detached house.”
“I don’t think I should worry, but this won’t collapse, right?”
“I think it’s fine, since a dome-shaped structure with only an entrance that was not designed for people to live in has withstood a shot from a cannon.”
Eh? What? You mean like a pillbox?
Isn’t it quite ahead of the times?
“Father, that dome thing could be used in a war. Can withstand magic? If yes, I think you can add a number of little windows to it, and in a defensive battle, it can become an impregnable fort.”
“I see… It could be good. I’ll propose it to others later.”
Ehh? So you didn’t think about it that far, huh?
In that case, you can use it for the defense of the town, too.
Hey, and if this building undertaking succeeds, why don’t we build a low-rise department store with five or more floors, eh?
We collect all the families in our faction and have them share the same place.
In doing so, we will get this world’s first general department store done!
If we secure the techniques for constructing the buildings with reinforced concrete, only the sky will be the limit for my dreams!
I’ll consult with Teal next time and ask him if there are any planned construction sites available somewhere.
------------------ 
Chapter 68 – For now, a meetingToday I visited Teal at his office.
I’m going to the castle for the first time in a while, heh.
If you want to ask me what I’m here for, it’s to hold a meeting for the members of the future gynecology team.
The place for it will be constructed in the near future, so for now, it was decided to meet each other beforehand.
Though, despite Teal being the one responsible for it, the one doing all the work will be me.
Wait a second! I’m not that knowledgeable about the female body, hey!
Look at my own body, you say? Hm…
That aside, now I sit awaiting guests in the office while the three men hurriedly do their work.
“You are quite busy, I see.”
“Yes, but it’s fun.”
Looking at Lords Earlgrey and Darjeen, they seem to be very dispirited. Are you really alright there?
“You see, during the weekdays we need to go to school, so the work has been piling up.”
Lord Earlgrey mumbled something under his nose, though…
“How about bringing the work to the school, Teal? It takes an hour to go to school from the castle; why not borrow an office and deal with it little by little?”
“Eh, and work even during the commute, too?”
“But the work won’t ever end, otherwise.”
“…”
“Ah, maybe dump the work all together, using the school as a pretext? How about it?”
“I don’t want to hear this from you.”
“Ehehehe.”
“I wasn’t praising you.”
For now, Lord Earlgrey has volunteered to secure a place in the school where they can do their duty.
You have it hard, boys.
“The guests are waiting for your permission to enter.”
While we were having small talk, a maid announced the arrival of our guests.
I and Teal went to the castle’s reception room.
First time using it, heh.
Entering, we saw four women, who quickly stood up and bowed to us.
Are they not nobles?
“Be at ease.”
When Teal said this, they all raised their heads.
Heheh. They are really something else.
“Miranda, introduce yourself.”
“I am Miranda from the ducal house of Mirandiehl. Pleased to meet you all.”
After my self-introduction, the four of them bowed again. Since none of them did a curtsey, does that mean that they are commoners?
After being told to be at ease again, the women looked like they didn’t know what to do.
I’m sure that Teal, being himself, said that he wanted a free and easy talk, but, with me, the duke’s daughter, added to the picture, it turned out like this.
“Everyone, you are all here because we want all of you to contribute to the advancement of the medical science dealing with the illnesses and poor health pertaining to those women experience in the department tentatively called obstetrics and gynecology. Let us all forgo all the stuffy formalities. Can I inquire as to your names?”
It didn’t look like we would start at this rate, so I tried to call out to them.
Recently, I have often been introduced to people who already know me, so I forgot that if I don’t say something to people like this, they won’t be able to answer.
And so, one auntie came forward and curtsied.
Eh? Is she a noble?
“I am Julie West. I work as an alchemist.”
“My. When you say West, do you mean the count West?”
“As I have been disinherited, I am now not a noble, unfortunately.”
“My goodness, please don’t be so nervous now. Let’s be more informal.”
Julie’s unyielding desire to be an alchemist, even in the face of disinheritance, shows her as a person who has paved her own road in life and now has earned herself the qualifications to be what she wanted to be.
“I am Light Bigsky. I work as a pharmacist.”
This time, a large and stocky woman has introduced herself.
A pharmacist, meaning that she’s a commoner. She seems to be allowed to study pharmaceutics on her own.
“Viola Divella, at your service. This one here is my daughter, Rin. We serve as a support for my husband, who is a doctor.”
Missus Divella was the seventh daughter of a viscount who married a commoner.
With her having the education of a noble, she should know women from families up to a count, I think.
I see, it’s quite a gathering of independent women who tried their hardest at what they do.
One can expect not only the advancement of medical care for women but also the work for the betterment of females’ treatment when it comes to moving up in the social world with the kind of people gathered here.
------------------ 
Chapter 69 – Let’s decide the direction of the gynecology department!“Everyone, I thank you all for gathering here.”
For the time being, I addressed them.
Hey, Teal. This is supposed to be your place, not mine.
“Lady Mirandiehl, I heard you advocate for the necessity of dedicated female doctors. I did see some noble ladies working as doctors, but the current situation is quite grim, with them not being at the forefront and noticed, I admit. Please let me help with whatever I can.”
“Advancement of medical care aimed at women does seem more likely to be spearheaded by common citizens who are more aware. For the noble circles, I’m afraid that the misinformation there is quite rampant.”
So said the Divella mother and daughter.
I see. They were often called upon to treat the noble ladies, I assume.
Men don’t really know anything about menstruation and are just making a perfunctory diagnosis, which in turn can lead to worsening of the symptoms for the patient.
“What symptoms were people most concerned with?”
The one who answered my question was a girl a little older than me, Rin Divella.
“Most cases are irregular menstruation, pains that accompany them before and after, the general feeling of weariness, and other related troubles. These are common.”
Hm, starting from the ordinary worries.
“After those, for example, the worry concerning what the differences in times of them occurring between mother and daughter could lead to, and, in cases of families without mothers, fathers often ask daughters if they are haunted by demons or such, what in the end comes to us being called to see them.”
Is this for real, Miss Viola?
I heard about the possibility of huge differences when it comes to this kinda thing, and, since these things are often told by mothers, in families, especially aristocratic ones that don’t have a second wife after the passing of the first one, such a thing could happen… An unpleasant feeling fills me when I hear this.
Then I remembered something.
“By the way, did you have to advise people concerning the change in personality for older women who have had their cycles ended or the sudden mood changes that depend on the menstrual cycle?”
The alchemist Julie and pharmacist Light looked at me with wide-open eyes when I asked this.
What now? This does happen, doesn’t it?
“Lady Mirandiehl, you are still underage, yes?”
“Call me Miranda. Yes, I’m yet to enroll in the school.”
“It is as you say; I do get such requests. As I deal with them through the use of medicine, it can help somewhat, but there’s still no solution for alleviating this problem in its entirety…”
Hehem. As I thought, menopausal disorders do exist here.
“Hey, Teal, say something, eh?”
“Aren’t you surprisingly knowledgeable about all this?”
What’s with ya, I too have this kinda information from my past life!
Not having a choice, I whispered in Teal’s ear.
“Since you had a hard time in the past, I had to learn here and there to, you know!”
“Is that so…”
Yeah, in our past lives, Teal has had to suffer quite a lot, so I at least tried to look for a possible cause for the mood swings.
Aren’t you all red in the face now, eh, Teal?
“F, for now, I’ll be bearing the responsibility for this, and, in the future, we will be using a special building now being constructed on the grounds of the duke’s mansion as a hospital, where we will be providing the medical care and conducting a study about the illnesses the women suffer from.”
“A praiseworthy ambition, I say. Let me help in whatever way I can.”
“But know that these medical treatments are still in their early stages. All doctors are male, so let’s add the female perspective to that.”
“I will be delighted to help. It would be my honor to contribute.”
“Also, I’d like everyone to help all women progress in society.”
After exchanging handshakes with each of these four women, today’s gathering is adjourned.
Though I’m worried, how long will I be able to keep up with the discussions between these sagacious people with my knowledge?
If I make a mistake, they could throw me out right then and there…
Anyway, for now, I will need them to teach me about the sanitary products that are used by women now…
Hell, Teal, why aren’t you helping anyway?
------------------ 
Chapter 70 – Eh, monster subjugation drills? Is there such a thing, even?Teal came to me today.
When school is not on, he comes for tea for at least an hour. But what about your work? Isn’t it piling up? You alright?
“I won’t be able to come the next week…”
What’s with you being so dejected?
Will you be that lonely without seeing me?
“Monster subjugation drills will start soon. Well, it’s not exactly dangerous… hah…”
“Eh, what’s that?”
“One of the school’s lessons. The nobles have this kind of duty, you see.”
Hoh, is that so?
Nah, I do remember hearing about this during my education.
Mastering the attack magic is needed for protecting the people of your territory, and the nobles living around places with forests, like margraves, must do the work of culling the monster population.
“Erm, you can use Fire magic, yes, Teal? It’s handy for the task; won’t you be okay?”
“We won’t be going to places with strong monsters, and at worst, we’d need to kill a goblin or two, but… the problem isn’t that; it’s sleeping outdoors.”
“Heh, camping, you mean?”
“Outdoors sleeping.”
Is this due to not having camping equipment?
“You should have a tent at least, no?”
“Yes, I do… It’s just that I’m worried about going to the toilet.”
“Well, do it while standing, no?”
“Don’t you dare continue.”
He closed my mouth with his hands.
Geh, it’s still better than if I told you what to do with the other thing.
Though I didn’t know that school does this kinda thing, huh.
Should I ask Father later for permission to set up camp in the garden? For practicing.
“Can you bring the food and stuff with you?”
“Jerky, water, hard-baked bread, and a sleeping bag. The tent will be divided between all of us.”
“Isn’t it just an extracurricular lesson, then?”
“But compared to modern motor camping, we’d need to secure a water source and find a way to ignite a fire, and I’m not confident in doing this.”
“That’s what the everyday magic is for, though…”
“About that… I’m pants at it.”
“Eh, for real?”
You are bad at everyday magic, Teal?
I’m quite good at it.
With cleaning magic, I’m not at Lisa’s level, but it’s enough for daily grooming, at least.
When I tried to light a fireplace myself, I was told not to steal maids’ work from them.
Also, I can fill a cup with water. Only for emergency use, though, since it’s barely tricking.
Practically, my cleaning magic can be used for washing dishes, and my healing magic can be used for curing scratches, like after plucking out a wood splinter or such… Wait.
“Aren’t you proficient with defense magic?”
“You see, I was impressed when I blocked a cannon shot, but… blocking other stuff is…”
“Then, let’s start a special training, or rather, a drill!”
“What?!”
And like that, we went straight to the garden.
I will teach you from the ground up about the importance of having a strong image when you use cleaning magic or create kindling with a fire-igniting one!
It seems that Teal hasn’t been able to properly imagine all that.
Now, thinking about it, Teal, while being an otaku, was on the consuming side and never once made something by himself.
Do you lack imagination?
And so, observing how I do the magic, I had him try and replicate it for an hour or so, and finally, the thing clicked for Teal.
Hmm. Royal magic teacher, aren’t you a sham?
Pants at it, my ass.
“Thank you for helping me, Miranda.”
“Well, try to continue training. I will be praying for your safe return.”
“Yeah, what a perfunctory reply.”
“‘Kay, go smash ’em up, eh!”
“Easy there!”
Hah, there will be guards, so I’m sure it’ll be all right.
------------------ 
Chapter 71 – The detached house has been built!It seems that the subjugation drill Teal went to the other day ended without a problem.
You know, he worried too much.
It’s not like they were thrown right into it without any proper equipment or anything, so it’s not that big of a deal.
I think it’s just forced training for new students who got bigheaded after learning attack magic, to show that they are still wet behind the ears.
Well, even Father and Brother Grande said as much.
That Rabble guy spectacularly got caught in a trap when he tried to defeat a monster in a cool way, failed to activate it, and had Teal help him out of it.
Yep, yep. It’s not good to get carried away.
Also, when I mentioned my desire to try and experience this outdoors, staying at least for a night and using the garden for a trial run, I got permission.
Whoop-de-doo! I can experience it now, too! It’s the garden, though.
Okay, then, the detached house has been completed today, and now this two-story building stands in all its glory.
We just had to wait for the concrete to harden, and so the exterior was done very quickly.
The interior work will take more time, however.
Even though it’s for their daughter, the Duke family must use ostentatious decorations and furnishings in the house.
“I can’t really do anything about the external walls, but there is no reason to put any furniture in there aside from my room on the second floor reserved for my hobby-related things!” When I selfishly said so, the construction time was, without incident? shortened to only one week.
As such, today I’ll be moving some of my things in there.
I’ll be promptly relocating some of the plushies that have filled my room in the mansion to the brim here.
I deposited them at the windows and the place where the entrance should be.
Then, in the room that will be the so-called personal office room, with the tea table for future gatherings placed here, I think it’s now easier to call my friends here.
When you enter the building from the front entrance, there are big stairs leading straight to my room, and the other rooms aren’t visible.
At the edge of the entrance stands a counter, which, when used for admitting patients as in a hospital, could serve as a reception for the whole place.
Since it won’t be a hospital right away but a research facility, I feel that for a while there won’t be much purpose to it aside from the waiting spot for a maid.
Further on the first floor, there’s a combined examination-research room that is arranged as was drawn in the blueprints, which were based on the image I had of the oldie clinics, with its makeup where you can go between the rooms as there are no doors.
The doors would only serve as a boundary between them and the corridor.
On the other side of the entrance, if you go further down to where the examination room is, there is another set of stairs that lead to a facility for hospitalization.
Also, we made an elevator that works either through magic or manually!
It’s an implement for moving things built with the use of already existing techniques. People can’t ride on it, as it’s very dangerous.
If only there was a braking mechanism known here, it could evolve significantly more, but alas, I’m not the one you should ask about it.
Would it be necessary to admit women who went into labor here, since it’s a gynecology department and all? Probably. Though, since we would be dealing with illnesses particular to women, including mental-related issues, and trying to heal them, we made all rooms personal, despite the small number of beds.
Hey, when it comes to childbirth, there are still those who think it will be alright to leave it all to a midwife.
And so, I think it could be better to see the patients who have a possible risk to their lives in here… Though now I wonder, when did Caesarian sections become available? I don’t know anything about it at all…
Well, let’s just hope that this and other problems can be solved by putting our all into research, which the gathered team members will be doing.
And hey, in that case, should we add a midwife or two to our number, then?
Eh, it’s not good to be hasty with all this… First, let’s focus on developing sanpro and painkillers.
------------------ 
Chapter 72 – A newly christened “Advanced Research Laboratory of Medical Care for Women”Today, I planned on having a private showing of the completed building with the people from the team and deciding the future plans for us to implement.
Ehhh, here comes the budget from the country.
Teal seems to have involved the Queen in this, and she, after deciding on giving the budget, also went and promoted us to a research organization that’d get national funding. Thanks to this, our name has changed from gynecology department to advanced research laboratory of medical care for women.
Well, who cares about that? What we have to do is still the same.
Though I needed there to be a figurehead.
As we would have to show the results of the research now that we are sponsored thanks to the Queen, my father, who’s the prime minister, Teal and me, and my mother doing the same, I now strongly feel that the point of my life is to be a guinea pig for all of them.
“Hello, Miranda the guinea pig here. I am thankful to everyone for sparing their time for me today.”
“Guinea pig…”
The others don’t look like they understood, but Teal had a distant look in his eyes. Stop it.
“Erm, for now, the tour of the interior has been completed; do you have any questions?”
Alchemist Julie raised her hand.
“You said that we can borrow the rooms in here, but can they be used for living-in? And what should we do about the necessary equipment?”
“Yes, you can live and work here without problem. The mixing and alchemy rooms are separated, so you can bring your own equipment here. If you need something new, please write it in this application form. After reviewing, I will decide on the budget.”
Handing the aforementioned form to Miss Julie while saying so, I saw her nod, showing that she understood.
“That’s what you should expect from a high-ranking noble, huh? I can’t see you as an ordinary ten-year-old.”
Lady Light~ I hear your muttering, you know?
Eh, going off of my mental age, I’m a man in his forties already, so I can’t really complain.
Next, the same woman who muttered raised her hand.
“I am fine with mixing in here, but, like with Lady Julie, I already have customers who buy my medicine. If I were to start living here, can I still continue to do sales after moving?”
“Ah, I see. I don’t see any problems. I’ll check with Father to be sure. Also, since this place will become a hospital, I already have a reception for that installed here; that’s why we’d need to hire a person who will serve as a receptionist.”
“Aren’t I just inconveniencing you, Lady Miranda?”
“It’s not like I will be in here 24 hours a day, so there’s no problem. Just know that you will sometimes see some aristocrats going here, so if you’re fine with it, then?”
“U, Understood.”
I have already planned to make a playroom in here, after all. Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia will be visiting, so I’d like you all to not freak out about it.
Well, that’s why I’m mentioning this beforehand as much as possible.
Now that the opinions of the two pharmacists have been heard, what about the Divella family?
If you think about it, they would be commuting here.
“Missus Divella, how about you?”
“We both will be coming and going here. We will visit after deciding on the day of the week. Is this alright with you?”
“I don’t mind. It’s still a long way until the place is used as a hospital. Depending on the menstruation cycle, I’d like you to see the patients’ condition and, as a first step, would need you to keep records.”
Okay, with this decision, the discussion has been wrapped up.
Now we need to decide on the policy we’ll follow.
“Let us confirm again what we should be doing down the road.”
With this, I handed a piece of paper to everyone.
Uhm, I wanna a blackboard.
“Teal, are there any blackboards somewhere?”
“There are. The school has them too. They are imported, though.”
“I guess I’ll ask Father then.”
Well, then, once again, we’ll be doing the following:
Confirm the current state of the sanitary products and seek a way to improve them.
Look for a way to relieve the symptoms that appear during menstruation.
I also added in there almost all I could remember about the conditions that appeared during the periods as I understood them from my past life.
Stomachaches, headaches, mental disorders like irritability and depression, a feeling of weariness, dizziness, and lightheadedness accompanying blood loss, and others
“Lady Miranda, despite the fact that you have yet to have a menarche, you are incredibly knowledgeable about this topic. Where did you learn about all this?”
Lady Viola tried to throw a dig at me.
The noble ladies learn it from their mothers, as is the tradition.
I know this is an abnormality, sure, but I already have an excuse.
“Thanks to Teal, all my girl friends are older than me. I had inquired as to the differences they experienced before and after they started having theirs. It’s possible there could be other illnesses mixed in there, but I think that mostly the information I have now is correct.”
“I see; you have a good eye for this.”
“Practically all these symptoms are treated as illnesses, but am I right? All of them are caused by menstruation, yes?”
Miss Rin and Lady Viola were quite impressed.
I think it’s due to their experiences.
“Right, as you are all adult women, I think you have the hands-on experience, and as such, these aren’t simple diseases, but each and all are physiological phenomena that come periodically, yes? That’s why, with the proper countermeasures taken, I think we can start at easing the symptoms and, ultimately, bring women to be respected in society. As this is a problem men aren’t able to understand, we, to be clear, must be teaching the population on a large scale, trying to eradicate the erroroneous belief that women are suffering from demon possessions or faking their illnesses. That’s what I think.”
All of them, aside from Teal, were so entranced by my words that I started to worry if I said something strange.
“Lady Miranda, you are ten, right?”
Lady Julie asked me.
“That is right.”
“Prince Dotteal, you have got yourself a fine fiancee, indeed.”
“I am proud of her.”
Stop with the praise, won’t you? It’s embarassing.
Wait, wait, that’s not it!
“A, Anyway, I think we should do it like this. What do you think?”
“”””No objections!””””
And so, with four of them in agreement, let’s get right into details concerning the research direction!
With the roles for symptom gathering and collecting information about existing sanpro decided, the day has come to an end.
It was quite a fulfilling day for a change since a long time.
------------------ 
Chapter 73 – Camping in the gardenNow that I had permission to camp in the garden, I gathered the supplies I needed.
A sleeping bag, a wooden cup and plate, and something like a small frying pan with a deep bottom.
Magic can be used to ignite fire, so I prepared a pedestal that will become a simple stove.
This frying pan is quite useful. You can boil water, cook meat, and make stews.
I also bought the preserved goods for the occasion.
They include things like hard-baked bread, dried meat and vegetables, and pickled vegetables.
With all said and done, this is somewhat balanced in terms of nutritional value.
Brother Tosted said in his letter that nowadays, the dangers of scurvy in sailors are known, and this is the answer to battling the disease.
Hey world, you’re kinda betraying my expectations for a minute there.
This isn’t one of those shoddily put-together Otome game settings, that’s for sure.
The steam engines have already started to spread, so I don’t really feel like the knowledge I have is something to parade around.
Returning to the main topic, the thing cost me quite a bit of coin, but I was able to procure a tent that looks like a triangle turned on its side.
Even in their disassembled state, the poles are long, and it doesn’t seem like I’ll be able to lug them alone.
With them arranged in a triangular shape, they should be standing balanced after putting them inside the tent and pulling on it outside, though it’s still quite scary.
Since I will be sleeping here alone, the smaller it is, the better, so should I try to improve it?
Moreover, the cloth used to cover it is just a thickly woven white fabric—nothing fancy.
No wonder, since rubber doesn’t exist. The waterproof cloth is but a pipe dream here.
In the end, with help from Lisa and our gardener, the tent was set up.
I have decided to have an overnight camping trip there.
At night, I tried to do it myself.
After collecting small branches and placing them under the portable stove, I ignited the fire with magic.
Adding water from the prepared flask to the frying pan, I then threw in the dried meat and vegetables, and, with salt and basil taken from the garden mixed to add flavor, the food was complete.
The hardened bread wasn’t easy to nibble on, so I ate it after soaking it in the soup I made.
The food you eat outside is very tasty despite its simplicity… Though if I were to eat it every day, I’d snap for sure.
Soldiers on expeditions, you have my condolences… That said, remembering the logistical information I have seen previously, they don’t really eat that poor a meal.
As they are able to be supplied with fresh vegetables and raw meat, that’s cooked and served right there by their cooks on duty.
Their bread, which needs to be kept longer than usual without spoiling, has less water in it for that reason.
As such, instead of dessert, they get rock candy.
Sweets are justice. I don’t think a revolution is necessary right now.
But when I become Queen, I’ll declare, “The military’s morale is supported by what they eat!” and try to improve their preserved goods.
The tastier the food, the higher their morale.
Otherwise, the troops will have little interest in fighting.
Well, I think that even if I don’t do something, the canned goods will still be developed sooner or later. They already do bottling, after all.
Surprisingly, the sleeping bag was really soft, so I slept like a log.
The next morning, I woke up to the first rays of the sun.
Ya know, the sunlight at the start of the summer is blinding. I can’t sleep.
My going to sleep earlier yesterday nothwistanding.
Having thoroughly stretched, I washed my face with cleaning magic, dressed, and went out of the tent.
“Good morning, Miranda.”
Where did you come from, Teal?
“The duke told me to come and see you before I go to school. He said you were camping outside.”
So that’s what this is all about. You’re such a worrywart.
“It’s just in the garden; there wasn’t much inconvenience.”
“What do you think of it?”
“I wondered how exactly the food the soldiers at camps eat tastes like. And the tent is big.”
“I see. I’ll try to eat it next time… As for the tent… well, there aren’t many people who do this alone, after all.”
Under the refreshing light of the morning sun, I ignited the fire and brewed tea.
Teal said he needs to go to school when he drinks one cup.
When I looked at the pocket watch borrowed from Father, it was only 4:30, man…
“Wanna do the camping together the next time?”
“Let’s do it after marriage, okay?”
Teal had somewhat of a regretful look on his face.
Well, no wonder. It’s very suspicious for an unmarried man and woman to share a tent together for the night.
The noble society frowns on it.
When he went to school, I tidied up here.
Well, I can say that I did enjoy my one-person camping trip.
------------------ 
Chapter 74 – Daily workAlchemist Miss Julie and pharmacist Miss Light have come to live in the detached building.
In the end, Father drew up an employment contract for them.
So, with most of their luggage brought in and anything they needed asked for, after careful checking of the contents, their applications were granted.
Until now, both of them, due to a lack of money, haven’t been able to research all they wanted, but thanks to the ability to request things, they eagerly used this opportunity, though half of the things they asked for were rejected.
There is no way you could be allowed to have something not related to medical care. The budget isn’t unlimited, you know?
Also, the counter in the building’s lobby has been converted into a reception desk for Julie and Light medicine sales.
For a little while, they’ll continue to sell those they’ve made until now.
As far as I heard, a lot of different analgesics already exist and are prescribed based on the type of illness.
This all looks like traditional Chinese medicine.
The dried leaves, which are rolled up in a pill shape, and their liquid extract are the things that are used.
Tablets are still a ways off.
Though powdered medicines have started to appear recently, which I had used for curing a cold.
I shuddered when I saw all that white powder.
In addition, when I asked Divellas, I learned about ongoing research into vaccines.
Is this for smallpox? I feel like the development of modern medicine awaits us in the not-so-far-off future.
Now, despite all the signs in this field of health care, the treatments for female-focused illnesses aren’t quite up to par.
That’s why we held our first assembly.
We decided to meet each other every week to exchange information going forward.
Today, ladies brought the collected sanitary products, but… I was quite lost for words when I saw them.
“Err… what’s this?”
I asked, looking at the things the Divella women laid out on the table.
“This is a rag. These are scraps from sewing factories. And that is, as you can see, a chamber pot.”
Are you for real? The hell is this?
Would anyone really believe these things would help with anything?
“Erm, will this rag and scrap even absorb anything? I guess I don’t need to even ask.”
“That’s right. Or, alternatively, you use the pot.”
“Otherwise you’d be stuck in the toilet. Some noble ladies also use the lining of the dresses they don’t wear anymore to cut a cloth out of it for putting in their drawers.”
I patiently listened to the sages’ explanation.
That’s… something. You can’t really walk around with a pot strapped to you, though since I’m small, I can get away with a long skirt to hide it, but… ehh… nah.
Moreover, one look at the cloth is enough to know how antisanitary it is. What the fuck?
“Chamber pot… won’t it smell if you don’t empty it fast?”
Miss Rin nodded sagely.
Thought so.
Ehh, is that it? Should I start developing absorbent cotton? Though, how would I go about it… Wait. The cotton fabrics are known and widespread here… Does that mean I’d need to only change how it’s woven?
“Should we try to develop a highly water-absorbing cloth you can use multiple times instead of this unhygienic thing? Let’s talk with Miss Rui.”
Later, we summoned the clothing specialist, the dressmaker, Miss Rui.
In doing so, we have drawn up a plan for underwear that will allow you to affix a cloth to it without affecting your daily life.
If it’s gonna be worn under drawers anyway, let’s make them more modern-looking.
Though, seeing as there’s no rubber, we mustn’t create something loose and sagging. Do we use a string to hold it up or not? I need to consult with Teal.
“So as you heard, Teal. Do you know any cloth napkins?”
“Sorry, I only used the paper ones… They are being sold, however.”
“Disposable ones are better after all, eh?”
“Yeah… Thinking about washing a cloth covered in menstrual blood…”
“Hmph… I’d like to have them be absorbent enough to last at least until a standard school day until they’d need to be changed.”
“Right…”
Uhm, but won’t it, like, be good to make a prototype with Teal’s help and improve it later on?
I don’t need to shoulder it all myself.
Okay! I’ll leave the development of the napkins to someone else!
------------------ 
Chapter 75 – Teal’s birthday party and changes in the worldToday I’m attending Teal’s birthday party.
With the greetings mostly done, when we tried to just eat food in peace, noble wives called to us.
“Do you have a moment, Miss Miranda?”
Ohhh. Judging by her looks, she seems like the glamorous beauty that is Lady Tolastina, only older… Ah, this is that: Arkray Duke’s wife.
“Yes, of course.”
There’s no way a brat like me has any right to refuse her; that’s a ducal family, ya know? Behind her, Lady Tolastina was present.
“I always hear you being my daughter’s good friend. Despite the difference in factions, socializing is quite important… By the way, there are rumors flying around saying how you immerse yourself in odd research, but what are you doing, if you don’t mind me asking?”
Uwah, your smile is downright terrifying.
It almost feels like a hunter staring down her prey.
Eh, what? Why are you that interested???
“Yes, at our Advanced Research Laboratory of Medical Care for Women, we try to develop specialized healthcare aimed at women. That said, I am just a figurehead there, and all our employees are quite talented, so I leave most of the work to them.”
Lady Arkray huffed and hid her face behind the folding fan.
“I was of the belief that you are seeking ways to rejuvenate people.”
“We don’t do anything of the sort!!!”
Why did it become like that? Rejuvenation??? I don’t know anything about it, though.
“My. I heard that a young woman wanted to research ways to keep her youthfulness for a long time.”
What? Is that due to that? The research for alleviating menopausal disorders?
We did start on this recently, yes.
“Ah… erm, strictly speaking, it is not about rejuvenation but more about preventing aging.”
“I see; that is what you meant, then.”
“Yes. There are times when women, after getting older, may have changes to their character, so we are striving to find ways to ease this kind of happening.”
Was the information slightly corrupted when it spread?
Though, in a sense, you can call them anti-aging measures.
Is the laboratory alright, listening to my offhand comments about the benefits of the soybeans?
“In that case, let me invest in you.”
“!!! T, thank you very much?”
Even if I say my sincere thanks, I can’t decide this myself, you know?
We are kinda from opposing factions, no?
“Thanks to your help to my Tolastina with the information you give her during your tea times, I have already contacted duke Mirandiehl about this, so you don’t have to worry.”
That’s a duke’s wife for you. She’s adept at laying the groundwork.
Hey, now I can’t even refuse her.
That’s to be expected, eh? But what was the point of going out of your way to tell me this?
“Lady Arkray, would that be all?”
“Yes, thank you for giving me a moment of your time.”
Thanks to Teal’s help, I bid her farewell, and we parted ways.
Ohh. I didn’t think I’d directly engage with the Arkray faction… The Karpf Tetra won’t let this go without response.
In that case, I think it would be better to have cordial relations between the three factions and put our combined forces into developing the scientific techniques.
But I’m sure there are some things they won’t see eye to eye on, so the dream of being all buddy buddy is forever out of reach…
Wait. What if we put the pressure from women’s side to not divide society into parts?
Men are always gonna try to up one another for the glory it brings until the end, but women are quite sly on this front.
The aristocracy’s way is to use anything at their disposal for the benefit it brings, right? Or was it the merchants’ way?
A little while later, ladies Tolastina and Cascia finally joined us at our table for tea.
“I’m glad to see you both in good health.”
“Lady Miranda, I see you are quite spirited.”
Lady Tolastina continues to become more and more feminine. Especially in the chest department.
“I have recently started to do what I like more and not only deal with business affairs.”
“While the lessons at the school aren’t terribly difficult, I have problems with my magic.”
Lady Cascia, too, grew up a bunch.
Damn, we have only a one-year difference, but to think that the growth varies so drastically between individuals.
I can’t help but be jealous… I don’t really have any womanly charm… still the same loli.
Oops, for some reason, Lady Tolastina deeply sighed.
“What is the matter?”
“Nothing; it’s just that Rabble has become a little distant, that’s all.”
“Ah. I think that any boy going through puberty will be charmed by your body, Lady Tolastina.”
“That’s… Eh, what do you mean?”
“Anyone will pop a bo…”
“Let’s leave it at that.”
Teal, who suddenly appeared out of nowhere, quickly shut my mouth.
“Let’s try to choose what you say, okay, Miranda?”
With my mouth still plugged up, when he saw me nod, he finally released me.
“T, That’s right. You are very charming, Lady Tolastina, so that’s why Lord Rabble avoids you. I do not think you should be worried about him hating you.”
“That is good and well, but I would have liked him to look at me like he did before.”
Yep, of course.
Puberty, the bitch she is, will make anyone redden in their face and try to avoid their eyes if Lady Tolastina were to approach them.
Fuck, I’m so jealous, I wanna grope her tits!
“Miss Tolastina, do not worry. When I talked with Rabble, he told me how dazzling you look in his eyes.”
“That Rabble is so cute with his innocence, heh.”
Heheheh. Stories about first love are always juicy.
“Lady Miranda, mind your smile.”
Lady Cascia scolded me.
That reminds me, does she not have a fiancé?
“I am still on the market. I envy you both. Will I meet a person with whom I’ll fall in love, I wonder?”
“What type of person do you like?”
After that, we enjoyed ourselves with girl talk.
I decided to ask Teal if there are any boys that Lady Cascia will like that he knows of.
------------------ 
Chapter 76 – Thinking of myself before othersErr, Miranda, who consulted with Teal about other people’s romance lives, or, rather, asked about the marriage-related stuff concerning other faction’s nobles, got “This isn’t something a royal should concern himself with or else” in response, to which she reluctantly agreed, is here.
With that said, I’m thinking about myself first for a change.
The advanced research laboratory, after being unexpectedly supported by both Arkrays and Karpf Tetras, turned into a country-wide project as a result.
The detached house we built is still being used as our base, but with the increase in people, it’s getting out of hand.
With the increase in female civil officials brought by Father, there’s no more hope for higher titles other than “Supervisor Miranda Mirandiehl.”
That aside, while I was wallowing in my depressing thoughts, the techniques have rapidly progressed, and every effect menstruation can have on the body is being collected and summarized from a scientific point of view.
Now, the number of researchers has reached fifty.
With this many adult females, who cover a large age range, you can easily study the symptoms to a certain extent.
Really, the personal differences can be striking.
Thanks to my being a Japanese male in my past life, I haven’t heard much of this, so now it feels quite novel, to be fair.
There are cases when you feel headaches or worse and tend to fall asleep, and, on the other hand, there are also those who don’t feel any discomfort.
Moreover, through probing those who come for medicine for their symptoms, we were able to collect quite a bit of information about female-related conditions they experienced.
In addition, we are now looking for effective analgesics for cramps by administering different medicines to different people after collecting the so-called painkillers from all over the country.
And so, even if someone suffers heavy pain, we could help them easily! At least, that’s our hope, anyway.
I don’t think it’s possible to find loxoprofen here, but what we have still beats not having anything at all!
That’s why I feel that, starting with the dissemination of what we found through the nobles’ academy’s students, we can bit by bit make it all known throughout the country.
The pressing problem is the absorbent cotton.
The cotton itself does exist, as I used some for nui stuffing.
Cotton doesn’t absorb water; it repels it… I didn’t expect it to work so poorly with water…
What works as a repellent is oil… As such, Lady Rui, as a manager? is now searching for a way to remove it from cotton.
If you ask me what would be best for sucking water in, I’d say that leaves us with tattered clothes or hemp cloth.
But using the latter would hurt as hell!!!
That’s why we continue to find ways to make absorbent cotton! I dunno how we’ll do it, but we must do it anyway!
In the first place, the Industrial Revolution is already underway; spinning and sewing are being done using mechanical machines.
And, if we succeed in realizing it, with that and including one-use napkins for nobility, we can make easy money and roll in dough.
Fufufufu. If it becomes one of the main products for export of our Karpf Theria kingdom, counting the technology for making them, wouldn’t it bring quite a benefit for the state?
Well, first we need to make it a reality for now anyway…
This all has already crossed the territory my knowledge is able to be useful in, so I can’t continue to watch over it anymore…
“Teal, how about you?”
“I already don’t understand anything anymore, either…”
“No wonder.”
“Yeah, we can only leave it to the professionals…”
While drinking tea, we, the two ordinary people without much insight into this, decided to throw it all to someone else.
As for me? I only continue to ask myself if it’s alright? Being the guinea pig for wearing a prototype underwear for a day for testing, or just signing the budget allocation forms that come. That’s all.
------------------ 
Chapter 77 – I found them! The bismuth crystals!Fuck yeah!!! I have found bismuth.
Well, the bismuth itself, or its ore, was already found a long time ago; in our country, it’s treated as trash that was left after the production of lead.
That’s why I haven’t seen it until now.
So with my recovery of the bismuth thrown out during lead processing, I can now finally amuse myself with the crystals made out of it!
“As you can see, Mother, I have made a new accessory for you to see.”
It’s good that using an ordinary kitchen stove was enough to melt bismuth.
Using the resulting crystal structure led to my making a unique accessory.
I took some varnish and painted the resulting crystals with it, so as not to have it oxidize and lose its color.
With the resulting striking rainbow colors, I wouldn’t want them to lose their luster.
“Quite a beautiful stone you have here.”
“It’s called bismuth. It comes from the mines the Marquess Saintgeorges owns, so if we just increase interest in it in our country, we could turn the waste products into more money.”
“Is this considered trash? Despite that, it has a peculiar shape, and the color scheme is very refreshing to look at.”
“If we match it with the dress I designed, I think it can turn out to be quite futuristic-looking apparel.”
Mother, closely admiring the accessory, looked for confirmation.
And, after seeing my design drawings, she nodded.
“Miranda, call Rui immediately. We will make the dress you designed.”
“!!! Thank you very much?”
“Why are you phrasing this as a question?”
“Uh, I just didn’t expect to get your approval for this.”
“What kind of a mother from a ducal family would I be if I didn’t support my daughter earnestly trying to bring forth a new booming trend into life? Leave it to me.”
After that, Mother attended an evening party dressed in the dress with geometric shapes that I designed, with an affixed accessory made with bismuth crystals, which led to the bismuth sales skyrocketing. So when I wanted to make new crystals and went to procure the materials, I found that the prices rose stupidly high.
Damn, creating fads is well and good, but I can’t enjoy myself if it all turns out like this…
Though, when I got a thank-you letter from Marquess, together with a monetary reward, I happily snatched it for myself.
I so want to spend it all away.
With my recent growth, I decided to make a couple of new dresses to wear.
It would be good to prepare for the upcoming social season of the new year beforehand.
Teal prepares the ones I wear to tea or food parties he calls me to, so the other clothes I must make for myself.
When meeting with friends or going for a walk in the garden, I do wear a dress, but when working, I have been caught wearing things resembling servants’ clothes, for which I was the recipient of disparaging comments by Lisa and Stella.
I can’t help it! I was working, you know? I can get dirty!
You wouldn’t be using a dress in this case, would you?
Well, usually I wear cute clothes, but everything has its appropriate time and place, wouldn’t you agree?
Maybe due to me dressing in casual clothes, the researchers, too, adopted a similar type of dress to use at work.
That’s so much easier.
Divella women, especially, were quite enthused.
On the side, however, I conspired with Miss Rui to try to create fashionable clothing for women to wear at work.
Ain’t it swell, though? With the planned social progress for women, it will be great if they, like knights, are able to easily wear trousers.
There aren’t any, so nobody wears them.
I’ll relay to them to go and try wearing them when they’re finished, while I can.
------------------ 
Chapter 78 – I have turned elevenThe time to greet the month of my eleventh birthday has come.
The birthday party, again, will be held by the royal family, and there, we will be officially announcing the gynecology department’s existence.
As a facility mainly focused on treating illnesses particular to women, the detached building we use will be open to the general public.
Me? I’m not gonna do anything, ya know?
Mother will be the representative.
The reason is simple: first, we’ll be dealing with nobles, and while the sale of medicines is a separate matter, our customers are still noble ladies.
After all, a simple, noble daughter like me doesn’t hold a candle to shrewd wives, so I was left with no choice but to rely on Mother.
In exchange, concerning the research itself, I’d need to try my best to be a leader in it.
“That’s what we will announce.”
“I get it.”
Today is my preliminary meeting with Teal before the party.
Thirteen-year-old him would be serving in the student council as a representative of the second years.
Since the school is mostly full of nobles, there’s some hierarchy present, but as a rule, people try to uphold the notion of equalness as much as possible, and, as that place somewhat serves as a meeting place for students of the same year, he can only become a student council’s president next year.
At present, some third-year male student is the one.
I’m worried that when I’m in my third year, people will try to set me up for this position.
When you look at the population numbers, there’s not much of a choice when it comes to aristocracy… I would be the most high-ranking of our age.
And so, we have come to the point where we can announce what we worked on.
As a result of the efforts of our own sages, we were able to create not only painkillers meant to help with menstrual cramps but, as a side effect, painkillers usable by injured people.
In addition, at my party, we announced cloth napkins.
I still have yet to need them, though.
Nevertheless, I feel the growth my body experiences.
I had gained some height, too.
Still… What should be growing has yet to make its presence known… And that’s while I try to eat balanced and healthy food.
Maybe it would be better to just forget and strive for the body of a model?
The woman’s charm isn’t decided by the size of her chest! Don’t yer agree, eh?
My mother isn’t particularly gifted on that front, either.
Lady Arkray, with her perfectly shaped hourglass figure, is often called by others a charming princess, while Mother is a fairy princess. Well, that’s what it is, but still.
Welp, that aside, we had been able to create absorbent cotton somehow.
Dunno how, but it seems that through valiant efforts on the tailor’s side, water can now be absorbed by that material.
After sewing the cloth, making the wadding for it to stuff in, and shaping it so the thing would be properly attached to panties, it was done.
Praise be to the completed sanpro. I was the only one who tried them, though. Yep, all hail guinea pig me.
With this done, we will be announcing it at my birthday party.
Aside from Teal and the King, there are only women here!
It would have been embarrassing to have men present at this, so after giving it some thought, I invited only women.
Now, then, how will it turn out?
It would be good if this all became popular.
------------------ 
Chapter 79 – Completion of the hobby room and girls-only meet-upSup, Miranda whatsupping.
Today I’m moving my office.
The day has come to give up the garden’s building, which I used as a second personal room, that is, the office room of the advanced research laboratory for medical care for women.
Furthermore, it was decided to build a hobby room for me in addition to what we have in the capital’s mansion’s garden (the main mansion is located in our territory, which is diligently managed by Brother).
“My dollhouse” workshop and jewelry workshop have also been moved.
I left my mother in charge of the laboratory.
Its scale has already grown so much that I cannot keep up, so let me be the first to say it now.
It had served as a good practice for going out into the world, but with the growing number of noble women from all over the country participating, my peerage isn’t cutting it anymore.
And in two years, I’m expected to become a crown princess; my work was taken from me.
With “you’ve got to learn everything about diplomacy and foreign relations,” there’s not much I can do.
As such, I’m relocating the plushies piled up in the office.
The hobby room is designed to have a salon on the second floor, and the first will hold various workshops.
Also, a simple kitchen for making tea for parties has been arranged on the second floor.
Up to two maids can be stationed there. Lisa will be one.
While I’m at it, I adopted the policy of not allowing boys aside from Teal in there.
Hey, I’m starting to feel like I can just count him as yet another girl, anyway.
Probably due to him being able to restrain his lust, there weren’t any accidents ever since. As such, with his wanting to play with stuffed toys and dolls when nobody is looking, I decided to occasionally give him a chance to unwind once in a while here.
By the way, in Teal’s office there’s one knight doll placed there that’s modeled after the widely known hero of the country, who appears in a lot of tales, the holy knight, Elexander, which I often see in different clothes, so I’m convinced that Teal secretly plays with it.
A couple days after completing the move, I immediately called my friends there.
With Lady Margaret joining for the first time in a while in addition to the usual Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia, we four had tea together.
All three of them are going to school already, and only I was left by myself.
Even if we meet at these tea parties from time to time to discuss the school happenings for me to know beforehand while we can, I’m still very grateful for their willingness to come to see me.
I, too, go and visit other houses, you know?
It’s just a pain to write about it, that’s all.
“Lady Tolastina, is everything all right?”
Eh, I smell trouble.
That’s probably it.
After all, the moment she came here, she, without even acknowledging the prepared tea, dived straight into plushies.
Well, she often does this kind of thing anyway, but her silent ignoring of everything and just trying to drown herself in toys will make anyone stunned at her behavior.
Ahh, you crinkled your dress. And hey, you shouldn’t try to crawl under them, or the stack will collapse… Ah, just as I said.
“Err, what has happened?”
When I looked at Lady Cascia’s troubled face, she answered me.
“Lord Rabble is quite popular with girls, so she seems to want to sulk about it.”
“Oh my.”
At this, from the collapsed mountain of toys came a voice.
“What’s the deal with him, anyway? I can’t forgive his grinning while being waited upon by a gaggle of other girls!!!”
Lady Tolastina, are you okay? You wouldn’t start tormenting those girls, wouldn’t you?
Her glamorous figure, slanted eyes, and ringlets all contribute to the look often associated with a villainess, so I’m a little worried… Please don’t go and get yourself condemned at the graduation, will you?
“But still, what could be the issue? I thought Lord Rabble was a faithful man.”
“Recently, with him getting closer to the prince, a lot of girls started courting him, and every time his gentlemanly way wins over reason, so the misunderstandings have started to appear… Especially with new students.”
Lady Cascia explained this to me.
Though Lady Tolastina still won’t come out of the pile of plushies.
“Lady Miranda, at present, Lord Rabble’s popularity with first-year students is at its peak! His honeyed responses to them are at fault!”
“Before, I had an image of him as someone more closed-off and shy.”
I cocked my head.
Wasn’t he embarrassed seeing Lady Tolastina’s body and averting his eyes as much as possible? Have his pent-up feelings exploded?
Later, after preparing tea for everyone, we continued our party. Thanks to Lady Tolastina, it all turned out to be a complaints galore meeting.
You know, all that time, she remained in the toy pile without showing herself.
She probably didn’t want us to see her face, though I wanted her to come out as her dress has turned into a sorry state. Occasionally we could see her leg or hand, and that, I admit, was somewhat of a captivating show…
When the time came to close the tea party, Lady Tolastina, having had her fill of the plushies and her complaints heard, said to me that she wanted to visit the next week, to which I agreed.
I think I don’t mind being her stress relief partner.
Please visit next time dressed in clothes more appropriate for diving into toys…
------------------ 
Chapter 80 – My Brother’s marriage rushThe gynecology department seems to be flourishing.
That’s because horse-drawn carriages incessantly come and go here.
Recently, due to our starting the development on the menopausal disorders front, not only young women but also older noble ladies and great merchants’ wives diligently paid us visits.
It even led to talks about expanding the back road leading to our mansion.
Father, wryly smiling, said, “I couldn’t even imagine it leading to this before.”
After all, we accept commoners in here, too… though the entrances aren’t divided based on one’s lineage.
They have stopped doing this kinda thing here in this country.
Sure, there are people with old-fashioned ways, appalled at using the same entrance as mere rabble, but, thanks to the noble school accepting ordinary people, for whom the way to go in was through the back door, these days everyone just uses front gates, which shows the current trend in the world.
Okay, at the end of last year’s social season, Brother Tosted finally found himself a girlfriend.
So the next month will be the marrigae ceremony.
As he was to be the next family head, he had quite a number of admirers, but he steadfastly ignored them all. He gave the impression that marriage was his second priority.
When I talked with him, he confided that he was hounded by disappointing women trying to marry into money, and, by borrowing help from the spies in our employ, he had them investigate the circumstances of different families, and as a result, he found that there were no decent girls of his own age. How sad.
And the person who caught his attention was the first daughter of Marquess Saintgeorges, who has been taking care of him in recent times. Lady Cascia is the second daughter of that family.
The marriage of the sea and the mountain nobles.
Thanks to my finding bismuth and our making waves in the social world with my mother, there seems to have been a spark that caused the previously non-existing good relations between the families to blossom.
With all this in mind, the eldest daughter of Marquess Saintgeorges, Lady Sasha’s engagement, was established during the social season.
Lady Sasha was quite a peculiar person who, like my brother, treated love affairs as an afterthought.
She loved starting new businesses and marketing and selling local goods to make the region flourish.
Her skills in managing the territory are superb, and together with the Marquess, she did everything she could throughout the place.
As such, lured by the promise of working in the dukedom and expanding it, she gave her OK to the call, and, what d’ya think, a fitting couple was born there and then.
Are they both okay? Would you even make kids at this rate?
So, with Brother Tosted’s marriage decided, the engagement for Brother Grande was arranged without delay.
His partner is the daughter of a baron.
She’s a maid of the castle’s magic knight order.
A noble maid, get! Hell yeah.
Though I wondered about the difference in standing between a duke and a baron, it turned out not to be a problem.
It seems that Brother Grande will be bestowed with the extra title of Viscount that we had and will create a branch family.
Brother Tosted is the duke’s successor, so that’s how it is.
And now, Brother Grande was patiently and diligently waiting for the announcement of Brother Tosted’s engagement.
That said, it looks like even before the engagement, their relationship felt like it had already gone beyond that of mere acquaintances.
Surely going on dates isn’t enough to be this close.
That scoundrel brother, when his woman paid a visit to our home, was smoothly escorting her, and, when she, Lady Elisabeth, was getting off the carriage, he brazenly went up and kissed her on the lips!
Well, in the eyes of the Karpf Theria, this closeness isn’t anything shameful for adult nobles.
But if he had a fiancee already, that’s when the criticism would have exploded in his face!
So, as you should know, this maid named Lady Elisabeth comes from the Curler baron family.
Again, I almost laughed out loud hearing that.
If someone introduced themselves as “My name is Elisabeth Curler” before you, any Japanese person would have found it hard to not show their emotions on their face.
My acting skills should be awarded the highest prize there is.
I think that the queen’s education helped me in that situation.
Just so you know, in noble circles I am known as a closeted maiden!
Since I don’t appear at official gatherings and don’t visit the territory, living in the capital’s mansion, these kinds of rumors have been spread around without reason.
Worse, Lady Tolastina and others have had the gall to snicker in my face at this nickname!
Well, of course! When I’m with them, my real self comes out naturally.
Eh, the reverse is also totally true… Lady Tolastina’s love of plushies isn’t known to anyone aside from two others who were present at the tea party the other day. Hohoho.
Now, then, I suddenly got myself two sisters-in-law, who have expressed their gratitude to me.
“Those napkins are marvelous,” they said.
Of couse they are. For working women, they are indispensable.
It’s a little pricey to make them disposable now, as aside from wealthy girls of Lady Sasha’s or Lady Tolastina’s caliber, you’d need to frequently wash and reuse them, or your funds will quickly go down the drain. This is our new assignment.
Also, Lady Sasha will be receiving a duke’s wife’s education for awhile in our capital’s mansion.
That said, with her already being from a Marquess family, it won’t be that hard.
With the addition of Ladies Elisabeth and Sasha, who will live with me, the number of guinea pigs increased.
Fuck yeah.
On weekdays, I have tea with my sisters-in-law every day.
Having discussions with older women is fun.
And exhausting.
Feels like I’m getting explained a soap opera word by word to me.
Especially the castle’s maid is a very proactive person in relationships.
Due to this, if her partner was a willy-nilly person, a bloodbath would be inevitable between them.
Ehh, is this the kind of life I’m gonna lead in the future?
Is it okay? I’m getting kinda worried here…
------------------ 
Chapter 81 – It seems like before enrollment, there are tests to doToday is a holiday.
Despite this, I’m visiting the nobles’ academy for the first time.
I had completely forgotten about it. Well, I feel like I might have heard it once, but I don’t have any memories of that. Nevertheless, here they are—pre-enrollment exams.
Even though it’s called a school for nobles, at its heart, it’s a place for learning magic.
As such, if you have a lot of magic power, any commoner would be welcome there.
If you strive hard at learning, you’ll get a scholarship.
The exams are precisely designed to ascertain many things, this included.
In this place touting equality, in its beg lecture hall, were quite a number of people, commoners and nobles alike.
Since I’m a duke’s daughter and rode here on a carriage as usual, I’m now wearing a dress.
Uhm, I feel out of place.
No, there are other nobles wearing dresses or formal clothes, but aren’t there a lot of ordinary people here? Wouldn’t it have been alright to come in workwear?
While I was thinking about this, an examiner finally came.
After urging us to be quiet, they distributed the exam question list to everyone here.
We have one hour to solve the problems.
All in all, there were questions on five subjects.
“Now, start.”
Immediately looking through the questionnaire, I saw these problems: write the names of people and countries, do simple arithmetic operations, and such before myself.
As I thought, this is a way of measuring our basic knowledge level.
After smoothly answering the questions, when it came to the third list, the scope of the problems quickly became weird.
Calculus; who’s discovered the universal law of gravitation; physics, like the speed of free fall of an object; and as for the history problems, the questions about demon hunts that were reminescent of my past life’s witch hunts and when they ended. There were those asking about the merits of stock companies in the section about the Reformation. The extremeness of the problems has quickly increased.
The hell is all this?
That said, I’m the person who aced the queen’s education.
There are no problems I cannot solve.
Still, was the entrance exam really this hard?
Ordinarily, the families that don’t hire multiple personal tutors, like barons or viscounts, wouldn’t be able to find answers to the questions on the third list, would they?
Hey, the fourth list even had complex and loaded problems…
“Regarding today’s problem concerning the treatment of female manual workers, with the data presented below as a basis, show how the overall working population has changed. Also, write how the country and citizens’ assemblies have tackled the problems stemming from the result of the aforementioned change.”
Wait, is this a nod to me?
Well, I’m at fault here since the other day at the laboratory I used the pie and bar charts in demonstrations that have become popular… It seems that the academy is now teaching them too.
What’s more, this female workers’ problem concerns ordinary people, so is the Industrial Revolution near? I think this is probably coming out of the development of factory workers’ rights.
Wage problems, denying the right to not be a living-in employee, and other things occurring in businesses treating workers almost like slaves, etc. Teal told me how the laws governing them are being revised.
Also, concerning the women-only illnesses, I am the one who has started solving them all…
Hey, should a prospective student be hearing this?
For now, I’ve finished battling with all the questions.
There are probably errors sneaked in somewhere, but that cannot be helped.
Those calculus problems almost tripped me up for a minute there, so stop with them, yeah?
Looking at everyone, they all held their heads in their hands.
No wonder… Surely there weren’t any problems meant for graduating students’ exams?
“Now then, this is the end. I am collecting your test papers.”
Having said this, the examiner went about collecting our answers, starting from the back.
It seems you don’t pass them forward.
Adults go around collecting it.
I went straight home after that.
That was all for today.
The nobles generally get pass marks without any conditions, and this test will decide who will go in what class.
When a commoner passes, they get a uniform sent to them.
The academy’s uniform is as follows: both boys and girls wear blue blazers, with girls wearing white blouses and skirts and boys wearing white button-up shirts and trousers.
The use of shoes isn’t designated.
Also, depending on the year, the color of neckties and ribbons differs.
We’ll be wearing pink! Wahaha.
Teal’s are blue, and Lady Margaret’s, who’s a year older than me, are green.
In short, my male classmates were out of luck for this year.
Well, some like pink, so it’s not all that bad.
I, too, love it.
I can’t wait until the uniform is sent to me~
------------------ 
Chapter 82 – The Industrial Revolution is, after all, all about economic growthI was sent my textbooks and stuff, along with my school uniform, the other day.
For common people, the stationery was on the expensive side and was sent with that, while nobles were assumed to buy it for themselves.
While we’re at it, both the textbooks and uniforms are paid for out of our pockets.
But man, thanks to my dealings in several enterprises, which bring me quite a lot of money, Father said to me, “Pay your school expenses yourself.”
What a blunder!
Well, I’ll pay for them anyway…
On another note, we as a ducal family seem to be providing the school with funds every year.
A country’s foundation is its education system.
If you want a comparison, this school for nobles is close to the universities of my old world.
All common people, in a Sunday school fashion, get their education in churches, reminiscent of temple schools during the Edo period.
Nobles, on the other hand, are taught by private tutors.
Okay, the important enrollment-related stuff that wasn’t sent today, that is, the stationery that a noble must procure for themselves, I decided to buy straight away! As such, I went out to town after a long while.
Usually I don’t go out of the mansion, though with me managing the “Goth Miranda” shop, I have had a couple of official outings recently.
That said, it really is quite rare for me to do this.
Generally, I call other people to see me.
Today my aim is to look for myself and buy that stationery, and with me getting wind of recent changes that occurred at the clothing and accessories street where “Goth Miranda” is located, I asked for permission and got it.
I went out surrounded by four guard knights and riding in the carriage, which you can’t really call heavily guarded.
And so we arrived, but…
Somehow, it has really become fancier.
It doesn’t come close to the level of Harajuku, but it has all those pastel colors and a gothic lolita feel to it everywhere.
Wait, did the number of similar stores increase?
I don’t remember proposing something like a sweet lolita, so I guess they developed it on their own?
The women walking around town are either fully decked out in this gear or wear at least a part of it, and this place overall doesn’t really look all that classist, either.
The only thing you can barely distinguish people by are the accessories they use.
For now, I went to “Goth Miranda.”
“Lady Miranda, we are delighted to greet you at our establishment.”
When I went in, I was greeted by the shop manager.
“Yes. How has the place fared recently?”
“The sales are quite good. The newly designed types of clothes that we got last month are available to even commoners, so they are very popular.”
“Well, I did design it with this concept in mind.”
The aforementioned design I came up with after meeting merchants during the social season who said that in the near future, the commoners’ income will rise, so they will be able to afford even the pricy brand clothes, and that’s what it led to.
The mechanization of the textile industry thanks to the use of steam and water-powered engines progresses smoothly, and in turn, this reflects in the dropping cost of the clothing itself.
Also, while I didn’t look, the country has experienced an agricultural revolution, and the population has grown.
All living organisms require food, sleep, and sex, so when the first is guaranteed and even increased, it makes sense for the population to balloon.
And the increased number of people will lead them to become economic nomads as factory workers, which will result in an increase in the productivity of many goods.
At first, I freaked out and was terrified at seeing 1 gold coin, but with the cost of living going up, it gradually turned out to not mean all that much.
I recall Teal wanting to revolutionize the currency going forward.
He’s going to introduce banknotes.
The first thing to do will be to create a gold standard.
The futures trading is already underway, so when he’s crowned king, won’t he be called things like “King of Finances,” eh?
Ultimately, the goal here is to bring about a managed currency system.
Lugging around all that gold is very inconvenient, so please hurry up with this.
Now, then, I need to do what I came here for.
“Manager, I am looking for cute stationery; do you know any good stores around here?”
“Cute stationery, you say… Not the one we have in our store, you mean?”
“That’s right.”
“Then how about checking out the shop at a catercorner from here? They deal with fountain pens there, which are popular these days.”
“Is that so? Thank you.”
Let’s GO! straight to that shop.
When I entered, I saw pencils and fountain pens aplenty.
That’s right. It’s a recent development that’s being sold on the streets.
Just a little before, we only used dip pens, and look at what we have now.
When you need something erasable, you’d usually use pencils, but I also want a fountain pen.
Alas, the only colors were the harsh ones, like black or dark red.
It’s for adults, after all… They are unwieldy to boot.
“Is the owner here?”
When I called to the back of the shop, a plump man came out.
“Yes… What brings you here?”
“Do you carry here thin and more brightly colored things aimed at younger people?”
“In the shop itself, there aren’t any, but we can take orders to make them, so please don’t hesitate to ask whatever you desire.”
“My, is that so? Then I’ll send you the designs later. Forward the bill to Miranda of the Mirandiehl ducal family.”
“Eh?! Are you Lady Miranda Mirandiehl?! P, Please forgive my rudeness!”
What now? You don’t need to be so frightened, you know?
Did he think I was an ordinary noble lady?
Thinking about it now, today I’m wearing a simple dress that doesn’t scream wealthy to you.
“Please be at ease with me. I am going to be starting the school for nobles next year, so I thought to make use of it while I can. How long do you think it will take to complete the order?”
“It all depends on the design, so if I can have a month, it will be done by then.”
“I see. Then, I’ll come up with the design at a later date. I’m counting on you.”
Okay, with today’s work complete, let’s go home~
------------------ 
Chapter 83 – I am summoned by the Air ForceMiranda, wearing a military uniform for the first time in her life, greets you.
For some reason I don’t know, the king suddenly said to me, “Come to inspect the air force,” and that’s why I got these military clothes on.
The schedule is already decided, so I can’t even escape now.
And, with our guard knights in tow, I headed to the capital’s outskirts in a carriage.
Thinking about it now, this was my first time leaving it in my life.
After riding for 20 minutes from the mansion, we passed through the town gate.
Oh, despite the walls that are used in our country not being that high, there are private houses beyond that 5-meter stone wall, too.
10 minutes later, even those had become scarce, and finally, we arrived at a grassland.
I thought there would be fields here, but it seems not.
There were buildings there, though.
Aside from the usual stone ones, those built with something like concrete were also present.
Are those spaces for raising dragons?
My carriage stopped before a stone building.
Is this the Air Force base, I assume?
Oh, so spacious. I even see something like a runway here.
“We welcome you here, Lady Mirandiehl.”
“I have come at the behest of His Majesty. I am Miranda Mirandiehl.”
I performed a quick curtsey.
The one who greeted me seems to be the Air Force commander-in-chief.
I’ve met him before.
His name is Morgen Gering, as I recall. He’s a count.
“I am very sorry that I called you here through His Majesty. Since I heard that you don’t often leave your mansion, I wanted to hear your opinion on this here by making you visit and look around the base, so I ended up using this method to do so.”
“No, I do not mind. I do think that with only a letter, I would not have gone out.”
Really, I have already gotten so damn many letters asking for my opinion from this guy, to which I came up with a lot of answers, though I still thought about visiting here sometime.
But, even though I am the prince’s fiancee, I’d still be stopped from this outing, like, “Now just wait a minute.”
And truth be told, I didn’t want to leave my home anyway.
Now, since I’m called here and all, I was told to go and inspect the site myself, as the Air Force that I came up with wasn’t faring that well.
Though, really, I already have a hunch about the cause.
I proposed using dragons for transport or bombing, and while they are able to lift weight that exceeds their own weight while they stand on the ground, it turned out that they cannot hold onto it for a prolonged time.
The whole problem now is that even though I thought of making use of dragons mounted by Dragon Riders for things aside from transporting troops and other war-related stuff, it doesn’t work as expected.
However, it is very useful for conducting reconnaissance missions.
The Navy especially requests them quite a lot, and, with the addition of the Air Force to ensure the safety of the sea routes that were kept safe before by the Navy, the danger of pirates or monster attacks abated.
All is well that ends well.
“Can I take a look at the prototype luggage carrier and such?”
“Understood. Please proceed here.”
When I was led to the wide place reminiscent of a runway, there stood a dragon and a carriage.
“If the dragon doesn’t take off first, it can’t grab things and then fly. As such, we leave the carrier on the ground, have the flying dragon hold this handle, and make it try and fly to the destination. But if the dragon’s grip becomes loose, it brings the risk of it falling, and so the number of convenient places to land becomes small.”
Ahh, so that’s how it is.
Hey, looking at the drago for the first time, it’s quite fat.
And big.
It’s like that when seeing it from the side, but since it’s tall, it looks unnecessarily giant.
If I were to compare it to something, it would be as big as a modern fighter jet.
The dragon’s overall length is around 15–18 meters.
But wait a second. How would you really use a fighter jet to transport the load?
To do this, you’d need to make it carry luggage on its back so as not to restrict movement, or have it carry it strapped to its belly. Wouldn’t this be better?
Uhm. It didn’t really turn out as I had envisioned it… What to do?
------------------ 
Chapter 84 – I try to ride a dragonOkay, since I wouldn’t understand much just by looking, I decided to ask if I could ride a dragon.
Nestled between the knees of a very rare sight—a female dragon rider—we soar into the skies.
“It’s a little shaky; hold me tighter or else you’ll fall.”
Having been told this, I tightly grabbed the saddle’s handles.
The dragon, flapping its wings, started running.
I see; that’s why there’s a runway here.
Hey, it’s hella wobbling when the dragon prepares to take off.
With the rumbling sound of stomping legs, my line of sight sways like crazy. It makes me sick.
After a little while, I felt a floating sensation… So we are in the air now?
“Are you alright, Lady Mirandiehl?”
“Not in the slightest. I want to hurl.”
To tell you the truth, this is impossible.
How can you all even fly like this?
Where’s my airplane, huh? And, just a sec, if you can’t fly without a run-up, wouldn’t it be safer to attach a glider to the dragon and have it pull it up?
“If it comes to this, I will not say a word about it to anyone. How about you try to take a look at the scenery? It will make things a little better.”
I tried to follow the advice.
Hm, yes, it got better. And now that I’m seeing it from so high above, the whole capital is visible.
Quite a breathtaking sight.
Still, isn’t it shaking a little too much?
Dragon Riders, you have my condolences.
When we were returning to the ground, the landing was not all that smooth; instead, we almost crashed. What can I say? The ride was truly unpleasant.
It’s good that I experienced it firsthand, and yes, you can’t really use this for transporting goods.
Aerial bombing is the only thing you can do.
Still, this requires having a casket attached behind a dragon rider and having them throw the bombs manually, and that’s it.
Hm… I need to rethink everything from scratch… Ah, that’s it!
“Commander Morgen, can I have a sheet of paper?”
“Here you are. Did you come up with a solution?”
“Let’s see. I think that we don’t really need to stick to having a dragon carry things.”
I answered Count’s question while making a paper airplane.
Okay, done. This shape should make it glide the longest.
“Quite an unusual paper airplane you made there.”
“Do you have a string?”
Morgen gave me one while sporting a doubtful look on his face.
Let’s attach it to the head part of the airplane… Done.
“Usually you just throw this thing in the air to make it fly, right? But if you carefully design it, it can fly even with a cord attached, you know.”
I took the string by the end, vigorously pulled at it, and the paper airplane lightly floated up.
If I continue to move at a fixed speed, the thing can be flown for a long time.
“In other words, by using this principle and having a dragon pull a winged object attached through chains, the flying force of that object will make it fly behind the dragon that will pull it, I think.”
“!!!”
What I proposed is, you guessed it, a glider.
I will let this world, which only recently experienced the emergence of a hot-air balloon, witness the sudden birth of gliders.
That said, it’s not like I’m that knowledgeable about it or anything. I don’t get aeromechanics.
I only know that the size of the wings and speed have an impact on the lift.
As such, all research in this field will be dealt with as I always do! Leave it to someone else!
Air Force engineering laboratory, do your best!
With this, after giving the paper airplane and picture rendering of the thing resembling the glider, which I called a “gliding transport craft,” to Count Morgen, I returned to the capital.
I won’t ever ride a dragon in my life.
Come up with other methods of flying.
I heard from grandpa-teacher that the Wind magic has a very high number of special qualities, so if it’s at all possible, I’d like to apply it to flying in the sky.
When I start going to school and learning magic, I will try to study it further.
------------------ 
Chapter 85 – Ughhh!!!Miranda Mirandiehl is here.
I am not feeling well.
Err, well, ya know. My stomach hurts. My waist is heavy, and my head is almost splitting.
This condition has been persisting for three days already… Is this it? The thing you’d think straight away?
Without any other choice, I went to the Advanced Research Laboratory of Medical Care for Women, aka ARLMCW.
“My, what brings you here, Lady Miranda?”
When I entered through the back entrance, Rin Divella called out to me.
“Ah, long time no see, Miss Rin. Say, is Missus Viola present? I want to consult with her.”
“Please wait for a little while. I see how hard this is on you…”
As there were other people waiting here, I don’t think she’ll come to see me that quickly…
In a couple of minutes, Miss Rin returned.
“Lady Miranda, if you do not mind, I could examine you.”
“Ahhh, I see. Thank you.”
It seems that it’s true that Missus Viola is quite busy these days… She’s always being crowded by noble wives.
Especially after we started researching ways to deal with menopausal disorders, the number of women hounding her continues to grow.
Say, Missus Viola, do you think it’s normal to make those noble women our guinea pigs?
“So can I ask you about what symptoms you are experiencing now?”
“Erm, stomachache, pain in the lower back, and my head feels heavy and hazy. It started around three days ago.”
“It came to you at last.”
“As I thought.”
“Yes, there’s no mistake. Do you have a napkin prepared?”
“I do.”
“Since it’s your first time, I do not know what amount of blood there will be. There could be a little, but there are also those who lose a substantial amount. It all depends on the individual.”
“I see. This really shows you how it affects your daily life.”
“Right? We have started looking for cures that will reduce the symptoms recently, but… Would you like me to give you painkillers?”
“Please.”
Oh, it truly makes you all bleary.
I didn’t know this would be so exhausting.
Though, looking at the situation, I don’t think it’s all that serious.
Maybe it’s because it’s my first time, but if this thing becomes even harder to bear, I will literally not be able to rise from bed…
It really dawned on me how this facility, which was founded to come up with a way for women to advance in society, attracts attention from nobles and commoners alike.
You really get the saying that if you don’t experience it for yourself, you won’t understand what people say…
“Here is your medicine to swallow with water. Please drink it with tea after eating.”
“Wait, is it okay to drink it with tea?”
“It should be alright, yes.”
Hm, it doesn’t seem okay for me, though… I think it’d be better to use water.
Something, something catechin?
“Miss Rin, if at all possible, could you find out for me if there are differences in the resulting effect between drinking this medicine with water or tea? I will test it too. I will drink it today with water.”
“You think there will be differences?”
“Yes, I really do. Call it my intuition.”
“We will see then. Let me confer with Lady Light later.”
It seems they haven’t yet researched the dangers of taking incompatible medicine and food together.”
For now, they just frantically search for and make medicine that will even work.
The chemistry sees some progress now, and various elements are getting found and chemical compounds refined, which will lead to further progress in what I mentioned earlier.
Still, medicine can sometimes be poisonous.
Even a working drug can be made worthless if one mixes up how and with what it should be ingested, so we need to define the rules and dosages for them.
But that’s not important now!
I’m seriously not feeling okay. No wonder Teal, in his past life, was often in a foul mood. In this condition, if someone were to hound me with questions and the like, I’d get off my handle fairly quickly.
In this new life, I’ve now come to realize and repent for how insensitive I was before…
When I see Teal next time, I will earnestly apologize to him…
------------------ 
Chapter 86 – Tea time with TealIt’s been a long time since we had tea together with Teal.
The other day I had the you-know-what.
There wasn’t much blood, but what’s painful is painful.
Also, this country has a surprising tradition of celebrating this kind of thing, though not with red rice like in Japan.
It was my first time drinking in this world.
Man, I already felt like shit then, and you then made me drink a small shot of red wine, even though it’s just one? C’mon.
Well, maybe it improved my blood flow, since that day I fell asleep very quickly.
Something along the lines of replenishing lost blood. There’s that kinda implication, they say.
If they pushed this on me so eagerly, I guess there’s a smidgeon of truth to this.
“Teal… sorry for me being insensitive in our past lives.”
“What’s with you so suddenly? You’re freaking me out.”
“Err, the other day I had my first menstruation, you see, and I wanted to say sorry for not taking you seriously then.”
“How was it for you?”
So I told him everything I experienced at that time.
“Isn’t it, like, weird to have this kind of symptom for your first menstruation?”
“Eh, for real?”
“Yeah, are you sure you didn’t catch a cold? It’s better to go check it with a doctor.”
“Then, after this, I’ll go ask women to look at me.”
“You better do this, yes.”
Damn… My apology backfired on me.
Hm, will this be the same after it stabilizes later or not?
“Well, it’s good that you finally got them coming. Now there won’t be problems with being a queen.”
“Ah… I’ll need to bear a child in the future, huh?”
“Please restrain your disappointment, will you?”
Eh, that’s not unexpected, I guess. Now a prince’s fiancee, later a crown princess, who’ll be a queen. If it comes to this, of course you’ll need to have a child later.
Gahhh! So annoying.
But I can’t continue wallowing in my misery… I can only hold my head in despair.
“Well, this is work for the future; now you don’t need to worry that much.”
“No, if anything, I can’t imagine myself doing something like this.”
“Did you forget how you pursued me for the same reason in the previous world?”
“I’m even willing to kowtow; just please don’t say anything right now.”
Damnnn… What’s so funny? Do you feel like you had your revenge fulfilled or what?
“Men are all like this, so it’s like I didn’t understand it or was resentful or anything.”
“Kuh… kill me.”
I banged my head on the table.
Shit, I didn’t think I’d get these words thrown in my face by him.
You really can hold a grudge, eh, Teal? I’ll remember this!
“By the way, Teal. I don’t really care about it, but let me ask anyway. Why did you come here after asking to hold a tea get-together if you just sit there and play with nuis?”
“I’m healing my soul.”
“Stop it… What happened with you?”
“Well, it’s not something with me per se; it’s just that the other boys are tiring me out.”
“What, did someone try to hit on you or something?”
“No, I myself am not popular with girls. It’s just that boys quite often hound me, asking for advice on how to woo and get along with girls, that’s all.”
“The hell with that?”
“You know, our getting along is already common sense by now. So they ask me how to behave around girls better, and it makes me think of you as a girl.”
“Well, I, too, am not really aware that you are a man.”
“So, when I explained, based on my wants, how to make a girl happy, my efforts bore fruit, and boys have started calling me an Angel of Love… Recently it got to the point where not only upperclassmen started asking me, but even older civil officials now look for my advice.”
“Why won’t you tell them off and go do their work instead?”
“Could be good…”
With this, Teal again started playing with nuis.
I’ve already told you to stop. Are you okay?
“How about we play dress-up?”
“Go and get a girl doll, then.”
“Yes, okay. How about you, Teal? Wanna wear a dress too?”
“I’ll refrain today.”
Today, you say? Does that mean you’ll be fine later?
Well, I’ll bring my two dolls now. A veteran Rami and, uh… Mei, whom I bought to be her maid.
Since they wear the same maid clothes now, I need to bring out some other clothes to use.
I hope that by dressing them up, we’ll be able to ease off and lose our stress.
Playing with dolls always has this kind of healing effect on you.
------------------ 
Chapter 87 – Going out on a dateWith the number of my recent trips out of the mansion increasing, Teal has called me out on a date.
We’ll be going out together.
By the way, until now we only had tea together or played with nuis, and we haven’t gone out like this even once.
Thirteen- and eleven-year-olds don’t really have a sexual appeal, but thinking about it, we didn’t have anything lovers would do.
And so, having been asked, “Wanna go out somewhere together?” we are now having an official date.
Teal’s being on summer holidays played a big role in this being at all possible.
An official date! Woooow!
Today, Teal will come to pick me up before noon; we will then go to a popular restaurant to have lunch and later head to the “Magic/Science Exhibition.”
Seeing it for the first time, I thought to myself, “What the hell is that?” But it turned out to be a mixed exposition for both products made using edge steam engines and magic tools that’s being held every year.
Until now, they used to be shown in tents outdoors, but this is the first time the fair is being held indoors.
While I wasn’t looking, people built an international exhibition hall, huh…
Father, I see that you had your work cut out for you. Where’s my money for proposing to use reinforced concrete for building?
“Hey. Miranda, you look cute today too.”
“I see you’ve become quite a charmer who’s able to say such things with a straight face, huh?”
“But these are my true feelings, though.”
“Well, you, too, belong in the cute category.”
“But my voice has already started changing, though.”
“Sigh. What a thing to have with a first-class trap face, man.”
“I can’t tell if you’re pleased or unhappy with this.”
“Eh, whatever. Escort me properly on our day, will you?”
“Okay, okay.”
Like this, we mess around with each other, making sure nobody hears our voices.
Unfortunately, the difference in height starts to rear its ugly head.
He’s already pushing 170 cm.
But still so thin and gangly.
He seems to be trying his hardest not to grow into the well-built physique that some knights have.
If the reason for this was “I don’t want to be hated by Miranda,” which is one thing and cute to boot, but in reality, it was “I don’t want to stop being able to wear dresses,” I almost fell down in surprise.
Well, whatever. It’s good anyway.
I got on the carriage, escorted by Teal.
Thanks to the recent road works throughout the capital, quite a lot of roads were already paved with concrete.
Of course, the back alleys are still just flattened earth, but having the main road done is great for now.
And, thanks to this, the road division was done, and as a result, the main road was widened considerably.
Teal was the one to start the thing, but the initiative to carry it out was taken up by the citizens’ assembly.
Having access to the national treasury for the redevelopment of the capital, which was considerably cramped before, helped a lot.
Peaceful times are the best.
After riding for about 10 minutes on a smoothly driving carriage, we arrived at the restaurant, which was located in a prime location in the commercial district geared primarily for nobles.
It seems that you can eat rare dishes imported from the neighboring Moulinie Kingdom across the sea.
It’s not that the Moulinie Kingdom cannot be reached by land; it’s just that to use this route located in the north, you’d need to pass through another neighboring country, the Rudolph Empire, so using the sea route is faster.
If I were to compare it to a country from the previous world, I’d say it’s similar to Italy.
Before getting off the carriage…
“That shop’s Italian food is quite tasty.”
“Hey, don’t say that, Teal. If you say it like this, Karpf Theria will be Austria-Hungary for you, ya know?”
“Mh, sorry.”
“If you let your guard down because there’s nobody besides us, you’d surely blurt it out before others, so get a grip.”
“Yeah.”
And will you stop having this kind of dangerous talk when you lay on my knees and are cuddled?
Now, with Teal escorting me, I got off the carriage.
Yep, he managed to look graceful.
I get that your daily work and studies exhaust you, but you’re the crown prince of this country, so try to be more dignified, okay?
Still, I can’t wait to eat that Italian-lookalike food.
------------------ 
Chapter 88 – Going out on a date 2“Mmm, so tasty!”
After being ushered into a VIP room on the 3rd floor of the Moulinie dishes restaurant, we are now enjoying our food.
Starting with an appetizer in the form of an assortment of ham, cheese, and herbs, the caprese salad was brought next.
Then, as the main dish, we had pasta and pizza.
Moulinie food is damn good.
It’s not like I’m disparaging the Karpf Theria kingdom’s food here.
Having become accustomed to eating a multi-course menu every day, this restaurant’s food feels a little fresh.
Our kingdom’s food, by and large, looks as follows:
Appetizer: today’s soup
Side dish: warmed vegetable salad
Main dish: meat or fish food—beef, poultry, or pork that is either fried or boiled. In our home, tomato sauce is a staple.
Staple food: bread (in the form of a bun, freshly baked every day).
Well, this is what nobles eat, anyway.
But look at the Moulinie dishes.
It includes a lot of food made from wheat, like pasta, pizza, and lasagna.
The cheese just melts in your mouth.
“Did you like it?”
“What do you think?”
“Right. This all feels rather nostalgic.”
“By the way, in the previous world, we often visited there, didn’t we…”
“That was cheap. Here, it’d be better not to ask how much this all costs.”
“Then I’ll allow you to treat me.”
Teal nodded his head at this.
The entertainment expenses are allocated from the budget, so use them more.
“Okay, Teal, say ahhh.”
“Wai… thanks.”
I had him “ahh” at me and fed him a piece of meat. You’re so cute, Teal.
Mh, but then he retaliated with the sudden… pasta attack.
What am I to do with you?
Opening my mouth, I had the pasta shoved in there.
“Yeh, tashty.”
“Yeah, cute.”
I wouldn’t be so sure of my cuteness right now, as there are no mirrors to see myself in.
Eh, I need not worry, though. I do think myself a beauty.
With my recent development into a model’s body, I don’t really gain more meat on me, so I’ve already given up on that.
Well, having a fitting dress is what I need anyway.
I’m not jealous of Lady Tolastina, not one bit.
After unhurriedly partaking in the food, an hour later we finished eating and left the shop.
Next, we headed to the exhibition hall.
Riding on the carriage advancing to the suburbs, we finally were able to see an imposing box-shaped building made with reinforced concrete.
“When did they build this thing?”
“They started construction last year.”
“Really… The detached house we have really was a test creation, huh… Their general structure is similar.”
Stopping the carriage at the entrance, we headed inside.
Today’s exhibition is for authorized people, and we’ll be able to mix in there easily.
From tomorrow on, this will be open to the general public, and the surge of people here will be unimaginable.
Even so, from the looks of it, the atmosphere here is similar to the Comiket’s east halls 1, 2, and 3… The size of them is similar, too.
Quite a gigantic thing they built here, on the outskirts.
From the halfway point above, the ceiling is made of reinforced steel bars, and the glass windows seem to be fitted in there.
Strange. I don’t remember introducing such a design.
“Why does it look familiar?”
“Because it’s made according to my drawings.”
“You clearly overdid it, Teal…”
“Fufufufu.”
For now, why don’t we look around here on our date since there seems to be an interesting event being held now?
What kind of magic tools and industrial machinery are here, I wonder?
------------------ 
Chapter 89 – Magic/Science Exhibition ~Industrial Machinery Fair~We are now at the magic and science exhibition.
The things displayed here are mostly cutting-edge magic tools and technologies in development.
First, we headed to a booth where the latter ones geared for use in the various industries were present.
“Ohh, the steam engines have certainly evolved.”
“It seems like it. They continue to be miniaturized.”
“Still, no combustion engine has been developed yet, huh?”
“Wouldn’t it be created much later?”
“I don’t really remember the history of these times.”
A lot of different external combustion engines’ APUs were present here, from the big ones that are taller than an average person to the small ones.
Nowadays, it’s used not only for cloth making but also in machine tooling, presses, and other stuff that appeared with the progress made in the heavy industry.
“Oh, a steam car.”
“Due to magic’s existence, it’s quite small.”
“Is this alright? Will gasoline engines or boilers appear next?”
“Who knows… From the perspective of preserving nature, it would be better for them not to appear at all.”
“On the other hand, if they continue to burn coal, the emissions will be dangerous.”
“Hmmm.”
“Will the cleaning magic help in this regard?”
“The principles it works on are different, so I think it’d be impossible. The magic only scrapes the dirt off the surface of the skin. You don’t use it for the laundry, do you? So here you have it.”
“True that.”
We continue to look at the machines here, having this talk with Teal.
It seems that thanks to the use of the MIS, the different companies’ machines are compatible with each other.
How glad I am for introducing it!
“Ah, Lady Miranda!”
“Yes?”
Thinking, “The hell?” in surprise, when I looked behind, I saw Lady Cascia there.
Well, of course. If someone other than my acquaintances were to address me directly by my name, they would be charged with lese-majeste in no time flat.
“My, Lady Cascia. What are you doing here?”
“Our Saintgeorges territory is exhibiting mining machinery here, and today I am helping with what I can.”
“This is quite intriguing. I would like to go and see them myself.”
Machines for boring earth? Though I don’t think it will be similar to an excavator, surely?
“This way, please.”
When Lady Cascia took us with her, what we saw on display was a model of a machine I’d probably seen in my previous life.
“Bu… bucket-wheel excavator?!”
“Oh? Were you already aware of it, Lady Miranda?”
Wait a second. This thing eats a shitton of electric power, and its hydraulics and pulley are made with freakingly durable metals that’s used in open pit mining, ya know?!
Why the hell is this thing here?
Who was that? Who brought this OOPART into this world?! And hey, it won’t work using today’s technology, ain’t it?
“As expected of you, Lady Miranda. While this is but a model, at present, in the Saintgeorges territory’s coal mining sites, the real thing that’s 10 times bigger than it is currently under active testing.”
“Is, is that so?”
Thank goodness that the thing is not that big that you’d be able to see it on satellite photos of our past lives.
The concept picture of the actual machine is provided here, but what was shown on it was not much bigger than a regular person.
But seeing its form—that’s a spitting image of what I saw before—gave me quite the fright… Could it be that there are more otherworlders here than just us?
This world doesn’t even have proper steam cars, so don’t go and create such monsters now.
“Miranda, do you know what it is?”
“Lend me your ear for a sec.”
Teal brought his face closer.
“This thing looks almost like the world’s biggest machine that I saw on the open-pit mining site in Germany.”
“I see.”
Don’t give that mystified look, okay, Teal?
“Please come and look at the other machines we have here. Thanks to Lady Miranda, our territory’s profits have grown tremendously in recent years, so we have a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay.”
I appreciate you thinking that. I really am, but everything I do is simply for my own hobbies and nothing more…
Well, if I am useful for others this way, then I’m a proper noble, aren’t I?
Now then, the magic tool exhibit awaits!
------------------ 
Chapter 90 – Magic tools, and also the weapons exhibition venueNow we came to look at the magic tool exhibit.
As far as I could see from the items on display, they all gave the impression of household appliances.
Following us from the machinery exhibition, we had guard knights escort us.
“Oh, a freezer.”
“Recently, with the use of Water and Wind magic, they were successful in creating the circuitry necessary for miniaturizing them.”
“I see. The freezer we have at home is almost the size of the storehouse it’s placed in.”
“An ordinary household won’t be able to afford it for now, but if it’s someone on the level of at least a baron, it’s possible to introduce it to many people.”
“Does that mean the high-class restaurants can start using it? Simple folk mostly use some kind of darkroom to keep their stuff, right?”
“Seems like it.”
When you look at it, it looks like a wooden box lying on its side horizontally, but opening the door makes the cool air come out.
Next to it is… it’s a kettle, isn’t it?
“This one is a quick heating type… do you think?”
“The teakettle, you mean?”
“Ah, it does look like an electric one, I think.”
We asked a clerk to demonstrate, and, to tell you the truth, the speed with which the water was boiled was on another level compared to those kettles that heat it by burning firewood.
It really is like a modern teakettle.
At home, we have a pot-looking thing, but it takes almost two hours to get hot water out of it, so this one is a huge improvement compared to what we have now.
“There’s really a lot of home appliance-ish stuff here, huh.”
“Well, of course. The magic tools are made exactly for this purpose.”
While talking with each other, we go from one booth to another.
“It’s a shame that there’s no culture of bath-taking, and as such, no hair dryers anywhere.”
“Want to make a bath in the castle?”
Being able to take a bath every day is quite appealing, but after living in this world for some time, I have already started to forget the need to use one, aren’t I?
“In that case, let’s dig up a hot spring, eh?”
“Good idea.”
Okay, what do we have here…
Hm? I noticed a girl with ostentatious pink hair.
From the looks of it, we are of the same age.
She has flowing, fluffy hair.
Quite a beauty, though not prettier than me.
Who’s this? The game’s heroine? Is this world really a game?
Though her clothes aren’t that colorful. She gives off the impression of a worker.
Ah, she was pulled away from behind.
Wait, what are the things on display in this booth?
However you slice it, it’s clearly a rifle…
“What is this corner’s theme about?”
“Here we have state-of-the-art magic guns.”
“A flintlock type, huh… What do you use for bullets?”
The things we saw here were apparently a bunch of flintlock muskets as well as short-barreled versions of them. And is this a blunderbuss?
I didn’t realize that in this magic-filled world, firearms could be invented.
“We basically use lead bullets with casting. Aside from them, during production, using a specific mana for imbuing bullets, we can give a person using them to apply an effect of an attribute not your own to an enemy you shoot.”
I see. It really is a magic gun. The name fits perfectly.
I so wanna have it. Like, badly.
Since it needs a muzzle loader, it is quite a hassle, but I still want to get my hands on it and see what’s inside.
I could probably improve it.
In my past life, I never really touched a real gun but quite liked airsoft ones, and this will be my first time seeing the real one.
“Miranda, you won’t say that you want one for yourself, will you?”
“Did it show on my face?”
“Yeah, your desire to have was almost overflowing. Ask your father for permission first…”
“Ugh, I don’t feel I’ll be successful with that…”
“Then, give up. I tried to wield one the other day, and I believe me, it was tough.”
“I bet. With this type of weapon, you need to be careful not to blast your hand off.”
“I can’t really compete with you, who have vast knowledge about the stuff.”
The people working here all had troubled faces, seeing the prince and his fiancee whispering with each other about weapons.
Sorry for giving you all the trouble.
“When I saw you, I thought you could be the duke Mirandiehl’s daughter, and it seems you are very knowledgeable.”
“Yes, I also very much like this kind of thing, so I learned this and that about it.”
“What a surprise… to find out that a duke’s daughter would be learning about this for herself…”
“I am the future queen, after all. I must learn about a lot of things that will be beneficial to the country’s future development.”
Please believe my excuse.
Sorry, I just adore this stuff, is all.
Still, I was very shocked to learn about the magic gun.
Teal! Let’s take it and revolutionize the military!
Won’t we be a laughingstock of the international community if we continue to fight with swords and shields?
With the advent of these weapons, the whole concept of war was turned on its head!
------------------ 
Chapter 91 – Returning home after the dateHaving looked through the whole exhibition hall, we climbed into the carriage to return home.
Of course, there’s only the two of us inside.
I really want to talk about various things we saw at the exhibition, but let’s start with what I wanted to do first.
“So, Teal! Let’s introduce the magic guns to the army!”
“Uh, okay, Miranda, but you can easily protect yourself from them with the defense magic, you know?”
“That’s only talking about 1v1, no? How about making troops stand in formation and having them shoot? You or me is one thing, but most people’s shields will shatter upon that, don’t you think so?”
“Hmmm, who knows…”
“Well, then how about using it for monster subjugation?”
“The weapons are already being used for that.”
“Ah, really?”
I, who was very excited after seeing guns, have finally calmed down.
How embarassing to allow myself to get agitated like that.
According to Teal, the guns are already part of the standard equipment for troops that subjugate monsters.
As for why I didn’t see them before, that’s because the Royal Guards’ main purpose is to protect VIPs, and firearms like those will be detrimental to that.
A non-aggressive defense policy is a recent trend in many countries.
It seems that there was a big war 70 years ago that established today’s borders, and since then, there have been no wars between the countries.
Though it seems that there are suspicious movements in the Rudolph Empire to the north.
Despite it being called an empire, the power of the state has become significantly decentralized, and even if there are no external enemies, there’s a high possibility of a civil war occurring.
In the Empire, skirmishes between its territories seem to be a constant thing as of now.
Compared to them, Karpf Theria is very peaceful.
“Still, you are positively glowing today.”
“Really? So I usually behave more adult-like?”
“No, well, it’s not like you don’t, just that I feel that your enthusiasm is pointed in the wrong direction.”
Hm, maybe it is, as he says.
“Miranda, are you tired?”
“No, I’m fine. But aren’t you the one who’s tired, Teal? You seem disappointed.”
“Thanks to you.”
“Oh, really? Wanna be cuddled?”
“Yeah.”
With that, Teal leaned his head in my direction.
“You can sleep, you know?”
“Okay, I’ll sleep.”
And so he laid his head on my knees.
Hm, what a cutie!
While petting his head, I got lost in my thoughts.
Recently, I have always been here and there and don’t have a lot of time to wind down.
Even in this world without the Internet and video games, life is quite hectic, with no moment to relax…
Teal was somehow able to make some time for us to go on a date like this, but usually he’s very busy, and it’s awfully hard for him to even find the time to do so.
I know that as a royalty, he needs to make decisions concerning running the stuff in the capital, but I still want to avoid situations where he must take these burdens on himself.
His Majesty the King is said to be swamped with official duties all day long… I really think that every department desperately needs strict definitions of what decisions it can and cannot make by itself.
Teal is still a thirteen-year-old boy, but since he must do a capital’s governor’s work, it’s hard on him, despite there being those who support him… Can I do anything for him?
For fifteen minutes, we rode on the shaking carriage.
And finally, it stopped at the Mirandiehl family’s capital mansion.
“Teal, we arrived.”
“Uh, I’m getting up.”
He sluggishly woke up.
I had my fill of looking at the sleeping face of a girly-looking handsome guy with blond hair.
It pulled on my heartstrings, I admit.
“Yes, I was reminded again of your coolness and cuteness, both.”
“Fufu, what’s with that?”
“Even if I, as of now, can’t really do much for you, please rely on me more. I’ll pamper and cuddle with you every time.”
“Yeah, you’re my only ray of hope.”
“Are you really okay there? Hey.”
I am sure there is a lot of difficult stuff going on with him, but I’ll ask about that in my hobby room later, away from prying eyes. He should hold the same opinion as me on this matter.
“Hahhh. I don’t wanna work.”
“I didn’t expect to hear this from you.”
“Didn’t you always say the same thing a lot in the past, Miranda?”
“”Even when at home, I wanna go home.””
We laughed together.
Ahhh, how great it is to be able to talk with each other without restraint.
“Come to my detached house sometime later, okay? Let’s relaxedly talk about stuff while drinking tea.”
“Okay, treat me well.”
Escorted by him, I got off the carriage.
After that, Teal climbed in there again and went to the castle. Don’t push yourself too hard, you hear me?
Next year, we will be able to meet in the academy, and I hope to be your support in whatever way I can.
------------------ 
Chapter 92 – I am twelve and I enroll in the Nobles’ AcademyI have turned twelve.
My womanly thing still hasn’t stabilized, though the second time it happened, it wasn’t that bad, but the first time… Ugeeeeeeeeh.
Fucking hell… Ahem, sorry you had to hear this from a duke’s daughter.
That said, half a year has passed since the day we went to the exhibition.
Both Teal’s birthday and social season passed fast and uneventfully, and with the coming of my birthday month, the day of the entrance ceremony came upon us.
I tried wearing the uniform, and it was very cute.
Its blue blazer made the long white pleated skirt stand out.
Another highlight was a white ribbon attached to the back of the blazer.
Ufufu. I look like a student in a high-class girl school.
Of course, I am a real young lady.
Now, after looking through the textbooks, I learned that I don’t have anything to worry about concerning studies.
It almost makes me ask, “Do I even need to attend the lessons, anyway?”
But there was no need to even ask, as I got an exemption from attending the lessons for ordinary subjects.
I am the top student among first-year students, after all.
As such, I can take any special subjects I want.
Also, I can’t wait to start attending the lessons on magic.
The grandpa-teacher has taught me the basic theory, so now we will be learning according to the various attributes of magic we have.
Mine is Wind.
After I took the entrance exams, I had my attribute checked, and, strictly speaking, the Wind is the one I am most compatible with.
Good. I, too, will continue the tradition of the Mirandiehl family, who are proficient in that magic.
Well, I mentioned that I’m most compatible with Wind magic, but it’s not like I can’t use the other attributes of magic and am simply bad at using them.
I really want to test them all while in school, so I’m going to take lessons about every attribute.
Okay. This year’s birthday party was held during the social season.
It’s because after school starts, I won’t be able to get a lot of free time.
Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia, though, invited me to a tea party they will be holding at the school.
When I enroll, there are plans to teach me how to use the reception room there while we have the birthday party.
I was told that anyone can borrow it and host get-togethers.
Though there’s a tacit agreement that only high-ranking nobles can use the room.
Borrowing it doesn’t come cheap, so of course it will turn out like this.
By the way, the pink-haired girl I saw the other day, when I asked our spies to investigate her, turned out to be a baron’s daughter.
Ah, I should mention that starting this year, Father gave me his approval for using our spies as I see fit.
God bless the usage permission!
To be fair, since I will be marrying into the royal family, I need to learn how to effectively use them.
I would ask you not to suddenly throw these tasks on me; I didn’t know how to do them before. Thank you very much.
That pink-haired girl, until last year, was a commoner, but when it became known that she’s an attributeless magic user, a baron’s family adopted her.
That baron family, McCain, is known for their magic tool craftsmanship.
And they are from our faction, ya know?
The reason for this is that people who can use attributeless magic have a big advantage in making magic tools.
It’s not like she’s an illegitimate child or anything like that, though it seems that there’s a blood relation.
As magic tools must be made to be used by everyone, when someone with an attribute tries making them, for a tool to work, it will become usable only by people with the same attribute, and the tool’s versatility will be low.
Due to this, all attributeless magic users work as magic tool craftsmen and are employed by nobles.
Our exclusive craftsman, who is the third son of a former count, is already pushing sixty; in the past, he was found to be without an attribute.
He’s responsible for the maintenance of the freezer and the mansion’s lighting, and he’s mostly just there doing that and not researching new things.
Still, the chandelier in our mansion’s lobby is something that person made.
What was his name? Dunno.
So, in the end, it seems that Baron McCain has got his hands on a magic tool craftsman whom he wants to raise for future employment at his home.
The name of that girl is Chris McCain.
She’s involved in the development of the magic guns and was selected for this exact reason, I heard.
I thought to myself, “She’s not another reincarnator, I hope?” but as it stands, due to the difference in our standings, it’s not like we can come into contact that easily, and so I haven’t seen her face-to-face yet.
As from now on we will be attending the same school, I want to engage in talking with her later.
Starting tomorrow, I will be going to school. That’s why I am now trying to decide what hairstyle will look good with the uniform.
Lisa has been filled with a startling fighting spirit this morning.
“My lady, what do you think about this hairstyle?”
“Hm, that looks good. Quite neat and tidy.”
For now, I have tried a half-up style, but my hair is very straight and doesn’t really work that well with it, so in the end, I had a half-down with a divided ponytail for my hairstyle.
Well, it’s cute, so whatever.
Also, when your hair gets messed up, you need to fix it yourself since you can’t drag all your attendants into the school to help you, so I decided to forgo making a complicated hairdo.
Still, I am such a beauty; everything suits me.
During the party the other day, when I spoke with a smile, even older men were red in the face, seeing that.
They were all so funny.
But listen well! I am Teal’s future bride! You can try and ogle me however you can; you won’t get what you want! And I don’t have any intention of indulging you anyway.
Tomorrow’s entrance ceremony, here I come!
------------------ 
Chapter 93 – The entrance ceremony! and the homeroom explaining the school’s facilitiesToday, having woken a little early, I dressed in my uniform, ate breakfast, and got on the horse-drawn carriage.
With the entrance ceremony and explanation of the curriculum, there will be a tour around the school today.
The size of the place reminded me of the elementary schools back in Japan.
There are a gym, a schoolyard, auditoriums for holding various events, and other buildings intended for the clubs’ use.
Each grade has three classrooms, and the rooms are divided by year so that each one has its own floor.
The first floor is for first years, and the third is for third years.
The school’s exterior reminded me of a scaled-down version of the Hermitage Museum, and compared to the recent buildings, it looks a little old-fashioned.
It gives off the feel of a school with a long history.
As of now, it’s still called a school for nobles, but from a status standpoint, it’s close to a national university, and you graduate based on the credits you achieved.
In other words, if you work hard, there’s a possibility of earning enough qualifications for graduation in only one year.
That said, as there are a lot of people here who enroll here to make connections with other nobles, there isn’t anyone who would do such an outrageous thing here.
By the way, Teal has already earned enough credits to graduate, and when he completes his thesis, he will be able to leave the school whenever he wants.
When I thought about what he could be doing here, it turned out that he does his work here.
In the previous world, we got to know each other when we had already joined the workforce, and since we both, during the university days, hadn’t had any partners of our age, we didn’t experience student romances.
It seems that Teal wanted to do some flirting around and making out while in school, so he tried not to graduate for as long as he could.
Bastard… Well, whatever.
We are already an item.
And I, too, have an interest in that.
Okay, passing through the gates, the carriage stopped on the campus, and I got off.
There seem to be other nobles who came to the school in carriages, too.
On the school grounds, there are dorms close to the school, though the dorms for nobles and commoners are in different buildings.
It’s not exactly impossible for people like me, who live in the capital, to stay there, but for the nobles from rural regions, it’s difficult to run to their homes from the capital every time, so they live in the dorms.
You can bring one servant with you, but during the lessons, you are usually alone.
Now, after verifying the place where the ceremony will be held at the entrance’s information board, I went there.
Despite the school creed of everyone being equal, I still ended up sitting in the front seat.
Unfortunately (?), in this grade, I’m the highest-ranked noble.
Well, of course I am. The ones with similar or even higher ranks are older than me.
If possible, I’d like to have a friend or two of the same age.
And even if I could, they would be only girls anyway…
And so, the ceremony has started.
After a quick greeting from the principal, the current students welcomed us.
Ah, it’s Teal. He’s a top student in his grade, after all.
No wonder.
By the way, the president of the student’s council is Lady Tolastina.
Teal, due to his government obligations, is not on the council.
“The student body representative, His Highness the Prince Dotteal Karpf Theria.”
“Welcome all who, starting today, will be learning in this academy. I am sure you are both anxious and hopeful. Nevertheless, during the school years, every student here is equal, and I hope that you all will be the ones who, in the future, will serve as the cornerstones of our country. As such, I implore everyone to devote yourselves to academic and magic studies, which will help you become the people you want to be.”
Yep, yep. I think it’s a good speech, filled with emotion, befitting a member of the royal family. But is it really, though? It’s too shrort, to boot.
“Thank you very much. Now then, I call here the representative of the new students, Lady Miranda Mirandiehl, to give her speech.”
Ahhh, okay, okay.
Now it’s my turn.
After I got 95 points in the class placement exams and got the top place, this role went to me.
When I asked about the tests later, there were, as I guessed, sneaked questions of the graduate level in there.
What a dummy I am! There wasn’t any need to solve those!
Well, I can’t really do anything about being the top student now, so with great reluctance, I acquiesced to their request.
I got onto the auditorium’s lectern and faced everyone.
Hmm-hmm. I see the pink-haired Chris here, alright.
“I thank His Highness for his words. We, the new students, pledge to make use of this opportunity to learn to the fullest and strive hard to work hard together for the bright future ahead.”
I bowed. Okay, time to bail.
Ah, I shouldn’t have bowed my head here… Whatever.
Usually, the nobles don’t lower their heads.
Everyone looked at me with wide eyes.
I said I’m sorry, okay? The child is father to the man, and all that.
When I am exhausted, I occasionally end up doing something like this.
Oh? Chris didn’t bat an eye at this.
Is that it? She’s a reincarnator, after all?
With the end of the ceremony, we went to our classrooms~
Everything inside the school looked ordinary.
If I were to compare it to something, the classrooms looked like those in Japanese high schools.
There are a lot of decorations on the outside, but the interior of the building is quite simple.
In this classroom, we will have homerooms, and for other lessons, we’ll need to move to different rooms.
The only required subjects are magic lessons for your own attributes.
We will really be starting from the basics during them.
Ah, the teacher is here.
A woman teacher. Nowadays, it’s not that rare to see them, but still, quite a lot of faculty are men. Does that mean she’s exceptional?
“I am your homeroom teacher; my name is Herminia. We will likely be seeing each other during homerooms and various school events. My main subject is astronomy. Anyone interested is welcome to attend.”
Hoh. An astronomer as a teacher… Now that I think about it, I still don’t know much about Uranus and the asteroid belt.
Since I now have a chance, why don’t I take up astronomy lessons?
I have already been exempted from taking general subjects anyway.
Let’s concentrate on learning specialized knowledge.
After that, we listened to her explanation about the curriculum and classes we decided to take, and the school visit ended there.
Now, starting tomorrow, the next week is dedicated to inspecting various lessons, and during that time we’d need to choose our electives.
What should I take, I wonder? I have to do it fast, or else.
------------------ 
Chapter 94 – Let’s make friends!The next day, after the entrance ceremony. Today, school starts in earnest.
This day’s lessons are—during midday, it’s general subjects, and in the afternoon, it’s magic and specialized subjects.
Apparently, the first-year students’ day is filled with a lot of general subjects they take and, in addition to them, with the afternoon lessons of their attribute, but, as I’m excused from taking the first ones, even if I slack before noon, there aren’t any problems for me.
It feels a little odd not doing much, so I think of maybe coming up with something to fill the void.
By the way, I said before that I’m the top student, but as for the next top achiever, it turned out to be the fluffy pink-haired beauty, a former commoner, now the daughter of a baron, Chris.
What’s with that? Are you the game’s heroine?
She’s, like me, also excused from taking general subjects.
Oh, and in our A class, there are three other people in this group of layabouts, the sons of a count.
You know, in this class, the next rank after me is a count.
What’s more, aside from me and Chris, there are only three girls in all here.
And the three of them are all commoners—the daughters of a big company, to be exact.
In total, there were five girls… in a class of thirty people. Not enough!
With that said, I tried to have a conversation with Chris right away.
To tell the truth, I am very interested in knowing her.
Also, this world is a reality. And even if this were a game, still, for a former commoner to have such academic ability, it makes me wonder if there are any nobles who are jealous of her out there or not.
No matter if everyone in this A class can study fairly, the truth is that this class has the biggest gap in ability between students.
The most exceptional first years are the ones who make up this class.
Even among them, I and Chris already have enough qualifications to prepare to graduate.
The ones above a viscount, or in the worst case, a baron family who’s on the same level and has the ability to complete the first-year courses, will be aggressively flaunting their knowledge, spurned on by their useless pride, so I, the member of a high-ranked nobility, want to become your shield.
Being in the same faction certainly helps, too.
When I approached Chris, who sat furthest from the front of the classroom, she started lowering her head little by little, then trembled, making the impression of a small animal before a predator.
Ahhh. She’s nervous, it seems.
Sorry? It’s not like I will eat you up or anything, so you don’t have to be afraid of me.
Sitting before her, trying to be as careful as possible, she looked at me with a face, asking, “What are you going to do with me?”
I won’t do anything… I just wanted to invite you to have tea.
Still, she’s quite cute.
As sweet as a small animal. It makes your protection instincts well up. She reminded me of a small dog.
But I don’t really like dogs all that much, though… I’m a cat lover.
Eh, enough of this foolishness, me!
“Good day to you, Lady McCain. It seems you were able to enroll thanks to your excellent results.”
“P, Pleased to meet you… Duchess Mirandiehl. I thank you for calling out to me in this manner.”
Suddenly getting up, she gave me a curtsey, though it was a little off.
Despite her unsteadiness, it seems that manners were drilled into her during the noble’s education after she was adopted.
You know, I’m not a duchess. You are mistaken.
Still, even if her knowledge of manners is superficial, she at least has a bare minimum to get by, so I’m relieved.
“Please do not be that formal; aren’t we the same age and in the academy, where everyone is supposed to be equal? In addition, you are from the royal faction… Miss McCain, how about you come with me for tea?”
Uwah, somehow, she started to shake even harder at that.
Is this girl alright? Am I that scary?
“A, Are you sure I will not be a bother?”
“Yes, I would truly love to speak with you. How will you use your knowledge in the future? What lessons do you want to take? I am very interested in all of that. Are you free during the midday?”
“Y, Yes. I wondered what I should do during my free time. I debated if I should go to the library or not just now.”
“I see you are full of spirit and desire to learn. Let us go there after the tea, as I am also interested in the library.”
“Yes, I will gladly accept your invitation.”
Great, that was what I wanted to hear. Inviting her: success!
Hey, but is there any baron’s daughter who will be able to flippantly refuse a request from an aristocrat like me anyway?
But when I tried to go to the cafeteria immediately and looked around, I saw that everyone in the class was staring at me.
I’m not some show for yer pleasure, ya punks!
Wait, will you stop looking at me like you can’t believe what you just witnessed?
Is a duke’s daughter calling out to a baron’s daughter really that rare of a sight?
Also, don’t you know that aside from her, there aren’t any other noble daughters?
“Then, Miss McCain, shall we go to the student’s cafeteria? Everyone here, please excuse us.”
Hohoho! Their gazes were so exhausting that I just grabbed Chris with me and promptly left the scene.
I hope we will be able to build a close relationship.
The girl, who meekly followed me, shaking all the way, really reminded me of a scaried small animal.
If I were to compare it to something, she gave the impression of a bunny stared down by a tiger…
------------------ 
Chapter 95 – I become friends (?) with the small animal by showing her my loving careWe arrived at the school cafeteria.
It’s open from the morning at 6 to 20 in the evening while the school is in session.
This is a very important place where they give you food right until the school gates close thirty minutes later.
Especially the older the students, the longer they will spend here, as they get enough merits to graduate. So the place is often filled with them.
There are already some upperclassmen arguing or reading books here while having tea.
No personal seating exists here, and you just take a free spot to sit.
In a certain sense, this space can be called the most fair and equal for everyone.
I heard from Teal that even if you are a prince, you still need to wait until someone frees the seat.
As such, there are a lot of students who arrange their lesson time so as to be able to eat earlier or later than the others.
By the way, the food for commoners is provided for free here, but the nobles must pay for their high-class meals.
It was explained in yesterday’s homeroom.
Of course, as the first lesson has just started, there aren’t that many people here.
While looking through the menu for something to drink, my eyes stopped at the milk tea set thing, which I ordered for us both.
This is high-quality stuff. I need to pay.
“Sorry, can I order two milk tea sets here, please?”
“Yes, leave it to me. I will bring the order to your table, so please sit here and wait until it’s complete.”
Huh, so the stuff for nobles is brought to the one who ordered it.
Oh, there’s a tag number attached.
It kinda reminds me of the service at an old-fashioned food court.
Taking along with me the small animal cowering behind me, I looked for a place to sit.
Since the weather today is clear, let’s look for a space at the window with a great view of the outside.
“Now, Miss McCain, please sit here.”
“T, Thank you…”
As I said before, stop twitching that much, okay?
Or wait, are you now in the middle of testing some vibration-based magic tool?
Did you forget to switch it off?
“Please do not be so nervous with me. Can I call you Chris? You can address me as Miranda, too.”
“I am very grateful that you chose to call me by my given name, my lady.”
“That’s okay. So, I heard that you have an aptitude for attributeless magic? You plan to become a magic tool craftsman in the future, right? I would like to be friends with you.”
“Oh, how could that be? I cannot possibly become a friend to the duke’s daughter, Lady Mirandiehl!”
Hmm, it seems she was afraid of me due to the difference in our social standings.
Her fear stems not from the thought that I could be a villainess who would torment her, but rather from the sudden meeting with an unfamiliar high-ranking noble itself, which puts undue stress and pressure on her.
“Chris, I permit you to talk your mind with me. Aren’t you forcing yourself to be polite?”
“Eh… still…”
“If you won’t listen to my suggestion, should I make it an order?”
“No, please do not. Thank you very much.”
She finally gave in to my assertiveness.
The worker has taken this moment to bring us our order of tea and cake as a snack.
Oh, it’s a cheesecake.
“Then, once again, I am Miranda Mirandiehl. Pleased to meet you.”
“Erm, then, I am Chris Meyer, or rather, Chris McCain. I am grateful for your calling to me first.”
“I see, your previous family name was Meyer.”
“Yes. My mother was originally from the McCain baron family, and my father was a commoner magic tool maker in the employ of a noble. After he died, my mother raised me by herself, though her older brother… the current lord McCain, failed in securing an heir and asked my mother to return to the family, and we got the title last year.”
“I see. Quite an exciting story. I presume it is due to your mother’s excellent guidance that you are so knowledgeable.”
“Erm. Fifteen years ago, she was the top student of her year, I heard. My mother was quite a bookworm in the past, and so her academic ability was top-notch. After having a big love affair in the academy, she later married my late father.”
Hm-hm. Love marriage, huh? That’s nice.
Certainly, the McCain family has often produced a lot of talented people.
I heard that some of them were able to become top civil officials, so I’m sure this assessment is correct.
If anything, I’d really like to hire Chris’s mother to work as an official at the castle… Chris herself, as far as I saw, can go a long way in the future.
“Well, for now, let’s get right to enjoying the tea. Since I got to know Chris’ upbringing, I’d like to explain why I have reached out to you.
“Y, Yes. Thank you, Lady Miranda.”
She stabbed the fork into the cake placed before her.
Ahhh, a beauty nibbling on the cake. Ah, now she smiled. So cuuuute.
Am I not smiling as a loon now, aren’t I?
“So, the reason for that is that despite you having the blood ties, I wondered: won’t other nobles be jealous of the fact that a commoner has been able to get a second from the top place? This made me worry for you. Also, as our families are of the same faction, I had another objective in befriending the person involved in the development of the magic guns. What do you say?”
“Thank you for your explanation. I was afraid of the gazes of everyone in the class and worried if I could even learn in the school.”
Ohhh, maybe, thanks to having a tea, she’s calmed down and the vibrations have come to a stop.
Have you finally relaxed?
“It seems you have composed yourself. If something happens, I will be your shield. Despite appearances, I am a duke’s daughter.”
“Yes, well… There is no need to humble yourself; you are a real duke’s daughter after all.”
“I guess. Sometimes, I forget it myself, though.”
“Eh? Is this true?”
“Have you ever heard rumors about me?”
“People call you a future queen who’s brilliant as a moonlight and who is often inventing new fashion and culture one after another…”
“Well, all royalists will be like this…”
“Yes, even after speaking with you, I am of the same opinion. The accessories and hair clips you are wearing today are all popular and trendy nowadays… I also heard that you are the founder of the Goth Miranda store.”
“Eh, to be fair, I did all this just to raise some money for myself while doing what I’m interested in in whatever way I want.”
“Wow…”
“As a result, everything that I wear ends up being at the forefront of fashion… So, Chris, are you really involved in the development of those guns?”
“Well, yes. That is right. I was helping in the development of the mechanism called flintlock.”
“I really would like to hear about this more! I want to improve that gun further so that it can rapid-fire 20 rounds straight or more in succession!”
“Ehhhhhhh?!”
“Are you surprised?”
“Y, Yes. It is my first time seeing a girl who is that interested in things like magic guns.”
“I bet… It’s just that I want one for myself, so yeah.”
“Lady Miranda… Do you always become this frank with anyone you talk to, or am I imagining it?”
“Ha, try and ask the same of Lady Tolastina or Lady Cascia. I know all their secrets as they know mine.”
“I am scared, so I won’t. And I don’t think I can. Aren’t they both high-ranking nobles?”
“Well, I am also the same as them, though.”
“For some reason, when talking with you, I feel like I talk with my girl friends from downtown.”
“Then please continue to talk with me as you would with them. I will not judge you for your rudeness.”
“Should I say, “Thank you very much?””
“It’s okay; we are all equal in the school anyway, right?”
“Hmm… I guess.”
I took a sip of the tea.
Yep, not bad at all. Worse than the one Lisa brews, though.
“When she is silent, she looks almost like a Princess of the Moon…”
Looking at me enjoying tea, Chris suddenly muttered that under her breath.
“Oh, you said it—the inside nickname the royalists gave me.”
“H, Hih! I am sorry.”
“I already said it’s okay. I have been told by many people the same thing. When my nature comes out, I always talk like that.”
Later, I learned quite a lot from my talks with Chris.
As I surmised, it’d be right to call the guns muskets.
In that case, if they develop the cartridge-type revolver, the weapons will take a huge leap in their advancement.
Should I show Chris my concept drawings and have her help make them a reality?
In a sense, it could become a graduation study for us both…
------------------ 
Chapter 96 – When I went to the library with the small animal, I met TealAfter enjoying our tea for awhile and discussing my plans for making rifles and bullet rounds, among other things, that are improper for girls to talk about, we decided to finally go to the library.
This is a school for nobles, but still, there’s quite a lot of material collected from inside and outside the country that will be a huge help in one’s studies.
If I were to compare it to something, I’d say it reminds me of the National Diet Library.
Most of the domestically published books comprise a large part of the collection here.
Are there porn mags, though?
When we were walking together, in front of us we saw a familiar blond-haired person.
“Ack.”
“What’s the matter?”
“That one is Teal.”
“Ugeh.”
Ah, she again started to tremble, man.
Get used to it already. This school is chock full of high-ranking nobles, so of course the prince, too, will be here.
Will everything turn out okay, I wonder? I am now worried for another reason…
“Heeey, Teal.”
“Oh, Miranda. What about lessons?”
“We are excused from taking them. This person here is the daughter of Baron McCain from our faction, Chris. Her desire is to become a magic tool craftsman, and she’s the only noble daughter aside from me in our class.”
“P, Pleased to me, meet you.”
Chris’s stutter is so cute.
“Yeah, pleased to meet you too. You are a very charming girl.”
“She will shoot ya with a rifle sporting this kind of face.”
“You can’t judge people by their appearances, huh… Miranda, don’t show her your bad habits, okay?”
“I can’t; I already did.”
“That was impossible for you, eh?”
While we were both speaking without reserve like this, Chris’s trembling abated little by little.
Has she gotten used to it?
“You are quite informal with each other despite your relationship and fame.”
“During official business, I maintain a proper appearance.”
I immediately tried to put on the mask of a good-natured noble lady.
“Were you not speaking, you’d be a perfect lady, Miranda.”
“Shut it, Teal, or I’ll knock you down. Before public, I still remain a lady, even when I speak.”
“I wouldn’t mind being pushed down by you.”
“Idiot.”
I pouted with a humph.
When we looked at her, we saw Chris laughing at seeing us talk.
Hmm, our comedy routine was a success.
“By the way, what are you doing here, Teal?”
“I’m going to the library to search for materials.”
“Then, as our objectives align, let’s go there together.”
“Ohhh, I can’t wait. A date in the library, eh?”
“Hey, do your work, okay?”
We kinda forgot about Chris while fooling around.
Eh, whatever.
Going off of our ranks, she won’t try to get forcefully involved with us.
“Say, Miranda, what subjects do you take?”
“As I’m exempted from general ones, all of those I took are specialized, like astronomy, archeology, and biology…”
“What are you even trying to become?”
“Ah, also, I’ll be taking magic lessons for all attributes!”
“Then you won’t be able to take archeology…”
“W, What did you saaaaaay???”
“During the first semester, Fire magic and archeology lessons overlap time-wise.”
Guh, I should have looked closer at the time slots for lessons in the curriculum.
I’ll check it later.
Otherwise, I’ll die trying to get to the lessons in time.
“Also, what clubs do you want to pick?”
“Meh, I haven’t thought about it yet. Should I help with your work?”
“I already have enough people hired, so I’m okay. How about you enjoy your student’s life?”
Hm. You say I can enjoy myself without reserve?
He thought that he was pushing himself, so apparently, Teal has recently hired some people to assist him in his work, which has led to his complexion becoming better.
If I were to try and barge in there with my help, I would make their work even harder.
“Then, I’ll take you on your proposal. I’ll try to look for one that will interest me.”
“I should mention that you need to be on alert for any girls that will want you to themselves. So bear it in mind.”
“Eh, what’s that, scary.”
“Lady Miranda is, after all, a fashion pioneer for most noble women…”
“Ahhh, that’s right. There are already people on the prowl from clubs like Gemsone Research Society, Dollhouse Research Society, and others… Also, Gothic Style Fanclub.”
Ehhh, what? Aren’t those clubs kind of inspired by me?
And wait a minute. It would be bad if I were to join the Gothic Research Society.
If I were to be hounded by otakus out in the open, my life would be forfeit, you know? In many ways.
------------------ 
Chapter 97 – A date in the library?“I am sorry, but I will be borrowing Miranda for myself, okay?”
Teal, without so much as asking Chris’s permission, declared this with a smile and took me away to the library.
Well, Chris herself had something to do at the library, though.
Eh, that’s okay.
Does he want to have me to himself?
Walking quickly, I was dragged to a bookshelf that was hidden in a shadow from the view at the information desk.
“What’s the matter, Teal? You seem to have lost your cool.”
“Don’t be close to that cute girl, you hear me?”
“Wait, were you jealous that I was with a beautiful girl?”
He didn’t say anything when I was playing with Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia before, so what has gotten into you now, Teal?
Could it be that he remembered the story or the game this world seems to be based on?
“Hmm… Probably, as you say. That girl is in the same class as you, so I felt as if you were taken from me by her, Miranda.”
So it’s not about a game or anything… What am I to do with you?
I don’t know what happened with you there, but please try to keep your wits about you, okay?
Left with no other choice, I let go of his hand and hugged him from behind.
“I can’t guess at what made you so impatient, but if you don’t tell me about it, I wouldn’t know anything, would I?”
“Yeah, sorry. It’s just that when I saw you enjoying yourself there, I had the thought that you would leave me alone and forget me…”
“I see. Don’t worry; I will always be your support.”
“Yeah, thank you.”
Hm. Have you calmed down?
I told you not to push yourself, as you always try to take a lot of things on yourself.
You’d better do like I do sometimes and just throw all the work at other people.
Nobody can do everything themselves; that’s why society’s organizational system exists. Even if you, as a member of the royal family, have a lot of responsibilities, there’s no need to take them upon yourself and take care of them alone.
“This is your bad habit from your past life. Randomly dumping your work on your subordinates.”
“Yeah…”
Teal, turning around, hugged me in kind.
Hey, when you do this, due to the difference in height, Teal’s head will tower above mine…
“Don’t grind your head at me! My jaw hurts! Don’t sniff it! Stahp!”
“Ahhh, so comfy.”
“You pervert!”
Damn it, man, you are uptight and no fun.
And that’s despite Teal’s recent unwillingness to stop wanting more when I cuddle him…
“Erm, could I ask you to not do this kind of thing while you are in the library?”
“Ah, yes, we are sorry.”
“S, Sorry.”
Darn, now we have a warning from a librarian-looking person.
And wait, when did they come here anyway? I haven’t even noticed their presence.
“By the way, Miranda. Speaking about your specialized subjects, we will be taking them together.”
“Hah? But don’t you have enough credits already?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Then why?”
“I want to see you at those lessons, learning.”
Ahhh, I see. Damn. Well, okay, do whatever you want.
If so, then I will ask you to teach me magic.
Doing that, even if I’m bad at suing them, I’d like to become able to use all attributes.
Heck, be prepared to keep me company during the monster subjugation training boot camp, you hear?
“Say, didn’t you come to the library with an objective in mind, Teal?”
“Ah, I forgot…”
Maaaan, get it together, Teal.
After parting ways, I tried to look for Chris, but my search didn’t bear fruit, so as a result, I ended up helping Teal find the materials he searched for.
------------------ 
Chapter 98 – The first magic lessonWe ate lunch together.
Thanks to his treat and telling me what dishes from the menu he recommends, I can live for awhile without exposing myself to the dangers of tasting everything.
Also, I decided to give up on a certain menu’s choices… namely soybean-assorted dishes.
As it’s food with large quantities of boiled soybeans, it’s often served with the main course as a garnish, but… Both me and Teal don’t like them for not being sweet.
I think that in this aspect, I still have a Japanese person’s sensibilities.
Just think about it for a second and look closely at this world, where anko and zunda aren’t sweet!
The magic lessons are starting this afternoon.
Just so you know, the lessons concerning my attribute, Wind, are held on Fridays. Today is Tuesday, so Fire magic is a given.
As today is our first lesson, it will be held in a classroom.
The magic practice field does exist, so I guess the practice there will be interwoven with lectures.
Even if the lessons themselves are electives, there aren’t that many students who choose ones not relating to their attribute; on top of that, usually only nobles who have magic attend them.
As the classes are divided by attribute, it basically means that everyone with the same attribute learns together.
Actually, this school is really similar to a university; there isn’t much point in dividing people by class when it comes to electives.
“I am the instructor for Fire magic class; my name is Farhas Freima, and I am a count. Since today is our first meeting, I will be giving you a lecture on the basics of Fire magic.”
Heya, Count Freima.
I heard that he works as a teacher, but to think that he’s an instructor for this attribute’s magic.
Of course, with him being a count, I have spoken with him a couple of times at parties.
He’s from the Karpf Tetra faction.
Now I understand why he’s a member of the Karpf Tetras, who are fervent supporters of equality. What with him working at this school as a teacher and all that.
On the other hand, the Arkrays provide a lot of money but don’t really have that many teachers here.
Well, they are more focused on the military, though.
If you go to the school for knights, almost all the teachers there are from the Arkray faction.
Also, every noble is duty-bound to attend this or the other school.
I haven’t really given a thought to the Knight School since, as a girl, attending there was out of the question right off the bat.
Despite Brother Grande being an alumnus of that school, my interest was so low that I didn’t really know about its existence right before I enrolled in the Nobles’ School.
By the way, I have already mentioned the gender disparity in our A class, but it seems that there’s quite a lot of girls in B and C classes. What the hell is with this unbalancedness anyway?
To tell you the truth, today’s lesson was really dull.
It felt like I was revising the magic basics.
Well, it was mostly a problem with me, as there were a lot of kids who fervently took notes in the class.
The content was similar to the daily magic, so not that hard, to be honest.
Still, as there seems to be some sort of compatibility, I felt like I got to know the needed frame of mind for using the Fire magic and its important points.
The so-called fire-igniting magic from the daily magic repertoire was, as it turned out, the same Fire magic.
This is what it means to be able to use other attributes of magic to some extent.
As for the Water magic, since it can produce drinking water, it’s the same.
It seems that it was achieved through the adjustment of an incantation and mental image so everyone could use it, so if I’m able to do the same, I can use the magic of other attributes properly.
I can’t wait to start enjoying myself with this research… Why don’t I become a magical girl in this world full of magic?
I won’t be able to refer to myself as such in three years, though, give or take.
If anything, I’d like Teal to become one.
Magical girls (otoko no ko) FTW.
The next lesson will be held in a practice field, so we’d need to go outside.
We were told to bring gym clothes for that.
Now, thinking about it, I remember receiving something like that.
Also, we were told in no uncertain terms to use the training grounds for preparing for the lessons.
There will always be a teacher stationed there at all times to quickly respond to any accident that may occur.
Okay, when the place isn’t crowded with people, I’ll be using it for my practice.
At home, I would need to call a knowledgeable person about magic to do this or forget about doing it.
------------------ 
Chapter 99 – Spending after-school time with TealAfter the closing homeroom ended, I was befuddledly thinking about what to do when the noble girls of the B and C classes surrounded me.
I got quite a lot of invites from the girls trying to build connections with me, going with things like “Let us return home together,” “Let us apply to a club together,” and stuff.
Still, they are really well-bred noble ladies, should I say? The only ones who called out to me were those whom I had greeted once before.
That means only daughters of counts and above came up to me.
As a result, Chris was given a cold shoulder.
Hmm. Should I go and introduce her here, then?
“Chris, come here, please. Now, don’t worry! Come!”
Standing up, I came closer and dragged with me the crowd of the noble girls who called out to me. They all looked like hangers-on like this.
Hm. I almost look like a typical villainess.
She started trembling again, see?
“This person here is Chris McCain, an up-and-coming future master craftsman of magic tools from our faction. Everyone, I ask you to get along with her well.”
“Eh, ah, oh, I will be in your care.”
Chris gave the girls here a shaky curtsey.
Their gazes became pointed.
I warn you now: if you try to do something funny, I’ll end you all.
Okay, so while all the chattering around me was continuing on and on without end in sight, Teal came.
So funny, seeing that the moment he appeared, the crowd before me was neatly divided in two, like Moses saw it with the Red Sea.
“Hello, Miranda. I came to get you.”
“Oh, what’s the matter, Teal?”
“You will accompany me now that school has ended for today, will you?”
I don’t remember promising such, but, well, it’s helpful anyway.
“Then, show me around to where the magic training field is located.”
“Yes, I got it. So, everyone, I am sorry, but I will be borrowing Miranda.”
After taking his outstreched hand, we went together out of the class.
Yes, yes! I was finally able to flee the encirclement!
“Thanks for helping me, Teal.”
“I thought that it would turn out this way, and I also wanted to have an afterschool date with you, so I came.”
“Afterschool date…”
“Say, do you really want to go and see the training grounds?”
“Ahhh, yeah. I want to try using Fire magic. Teach me.”
“Hm, okay, but isn’t your attribute Wind?”
“That’s right, but I want to use Fire. And you do have the knowledge, am I right? The king can use all attributes, I recall.”
“Well, yes… Why not? Let’s learn the magic together.”
“Try to forget about the work sometimes and just be a simple student, okay?”
“Since you took lessons for all attributes, why don’t we start from the basics of Wind and Water magic?”
“That’s fine.”
After walking like this for a while, we arrived at the training grounds.
The upperclassmen were practicing there, but we were able to find an occupied place anyway.
“Okay, let’s borrow a lane. I believe you can reserve it for an hour.”
“I see, there’s a time limit here.”
“You apply for this at that reception desk there.”
Got it. That guardroom-looking place, huh?
Since I’d need to do it in the future alone, I went to the place by myself.
“Excuse me, can I apply for a magic training line?”
“Yes, wait a minute. Please fill out this form.”
“I understand.”
“While you are writing in the form, I will explain the important points in the meantime. I am sure you will be alright, as you came with the accompaniment of the prince. I ask you to refrain from conducting dangerous acts. Pointing your magic attacks at people is grounds for immediate suspension, so be aware. I do not think it is possible, but in the case of your magic going out of control, try to get close to the target and not your surroundings. When releasing magic, you must also aim for the target, as there is a permanent defense magic protection installed that won’t break with just a small force or attack the students usually shoot it with. Rather, be sure to always practice with this in mind, as to maintain the safety of the surroundings.”
“Yes, I understand. I have finished filling out the form. Please check it.”
“Everything is in order. You have an hour. When the allotted time runs out, you will be called by the person in charge, so I ask you to free the borrowed lane then.”
OK, OK. Erm. The place is Lane B, the one that was unoccupied before.
“Teal, I did it.”
“It’s good we didn’t need to wait. During the end of the term, it’s always crowded. Everyone wants to practice for the tests on magic.”
“I bet, yeah. When it comes to this, should I train at home then?”
“That’s one possibility.”
Okay, let the magic learning together with Teal start!
------------------ 
Chapter 100 – Let’s try using magicThe training lane reminded me of an archery range where you practice shooting with a bow.
The target at the end of the lane was placed quite a distance from your position.
Probably due to the number of lanes going from A to Z, they are partitioned so that you won’t need to pay attention to your sides.
Now then. Let’s immediately get the textbook and start on the page with the beginner-level magic.
I see, as I thought. The beginner Fire magic is the one where you throw a ball of fire.
“First is Fireball, I guess. One of the starting magics.”
Teal, standing beside me, peeked into the textbook.
Your face is close! Don’t frighten me like that!
Ya know, because your face is pretty, when you make me look at it so close up, it makes my heart skip a beat.
“F, For now, I remembered the incantation. Can I test it?”
“If you want to shoot, then turn to the target. Having defense magic is good and all, but I don’t wanna get hit by you directly.”
“Knave, know this! When we will be having arguments, I don’t expect myself to lose!”
“Miranda, are you planning on destoying the castle?”
“Do the king and the queen not fight?”
“Of course they do, but not to the extent of throwing plates or indiscriminately shooting magic, no… Your parents, I assume, are the same.”
“Well, that’s true… But I haven’t ever seen them having a spat at all. I don’t really want our quarrels to turn physical the moment I become your queen.”
“Yeah, let’s try to always talk it out.”
Yep yep. This is the way.
Now, let’s get right to it.
It’s written in the textbook that you need to face the target and fix your aim, but how do you do this?
“Hey, Teal. How do you fix your aim?”
“It depends on the person. I did it by stretching my arms and aiming like that, but after getting used to it, I don’t need to.”
“I see. I’ll try.”
I make my hand into the shape of a gun.
Now I need to recite the incantation…
“Fiyahball!”
Poof.
Smoke billowed.
The fire didn’t come out.
“Maybe you made a mistake with your pronunciation? Did you bite your tongue? I’ll show you how it’s done once.”
“M, Much obliged.”
“Okay, pay attention… Fireball!”
With a rumbling noise, the ball of fire flew out.
It hit the target and burned it up. Is this okay?
Oh, it disappeared.
“I see; it’s done like this. But what’s with that target? Does it repair itself?”
“You don’t need to concern yourself with that for now. Just try shooting again.”
“You are right. I have the image down now. I didn’t really grasp before how to make a fire appear out of thin air, I guess.”
I faced the target again and took a stance.
“Fireball!”
A ball of fire the size of a ping-pong ball flew out.
Oh, it seems I was successful.
Compared to the one Teal fired, it’s small, but for the time being, I managed to make the fire appear.
“Teal, I did it!”
“Yeah, now you just need a lot of practice. It’s a little bit too weak to be used in a real situation.”
“I wonder if I get credits for this…”
“Magic lessons aren’t just about practical skills, so I think you will be okay.”
“I understand. Then there is nothing to worry about. Let’s continue practicing.”
And so, I repeatedly shot out the balls of fire the same size as before.
Hm? Can I possibly dual-wield these fireballs?
I was gradually getting used to shooting and making both the incantation and the chant shorter and shorter, but there was no change in the power of the balls.
Then I’ll shoot more fireballs.
“Ahahahahaha!!!”
With the increase in shooting speed, I started enjoying it more. Even if one shot doesn’t have much power, the larger number of them will help it spread wide, won’t it?
“Hey! Miranda, you overdid it!”
“Hah, hah, hah. This is fun, Teal.”
“But your mana has almost run out… Even a fireball uses some mana, you know.”
Ahhh, honestly! I pushed myself a little too hard.
Due to depleting my mana, I feel quite exhausted.
As expected, the mana consumption of the magic of the attributes you are not good with is nothing to sniff at…
“But you have shown me something incredible. I’ll try doing the same now.”
“Can I rest in the back?”
“Yeah, I’ll escort you home later, Miranda.”
After that, I got to see Teal’s merciless fire magic rapid-firing cannon, and I understood just how different it is for the people using the attribute they have the most affinity for.
I understand now why nobles don’t usually sign up for classes not related to their attributes.
Still, I won’t give up! I’ll show you how I become a user of all attributes!
The low power of most of them notwithstanding.
------------------ 
Chapter 101 – The end of the first week.After looking into the classes I was interested in and coming up with my own curriculum by throwing out those I thought wouldn’t be needed, I ended up with a schedule with a lot of free time.
I knew from the start of this possibility, though, as I don’t need to attend general subjects’ lessons.
The school itself had only one homeroom a week, and when it became clear to me that other than that, you are basically free, I managed to get a day where I don’t have classes at all.
Hell yeah! Every Thursday is the day when I can rest!
But with this, it’s already clear that life in this school is like life in a Japanese university.
At first, I thought that this was closer to a high school, but my doubts were cleared.
However, this is probably due to my having final grades for general subjects, which got me the exemption from taking them.
B class and lower; if the students there don’t take all classes, they won’t be able to get enough credits. And if you are of a lower rank in the A class, by taking the 2~3 year worth of basic subjects during the first year, later you’ll have it easier. But in general, it’s common for students to have their first year full of classes.
Teal has for days a week free.
When I thought about what he could be doing at the school, it turned out that he was working.
Workaholic much? It feels more than that, so I’m worried.
Even in his past life, his work ethic was very similar to that of those working for black companies, so I think he just doesn’t know how to relax.
On the other hand, here I am with my devil-may-care attitude…
Now, thinking about it, his being jealous of me getting close to girls rather than boys is affected in large part by his memories of his past life.
By the way, when I think about how Teal talks with other boys, it makes my heart ache.
We are two of a kind in this regard.
And that, despite not really having any need to worry… Or is it?
I think I would be troubled if Teal had his back spelunk by another man, though.
That aside, for the time being, I decided to take classes on every magic attribute.
There were other classes directly connected to your future profession, like lectures on creating magic tools, but as for me, I chose astronomy for myself.
Before you graduate, you need to take at least five specialized classes, so in addition, I selected biology and physics.
I decided not to take up archeology. There’s always the next year.
Also, I promised to have tea with Lady Tolastina and the others, but that will be next week.
Lady Tolastina and Lady Cascia are both third-year students in the B class, but it seems that they are having troubles with their lessons.
Rather, they came to me crying, asking for help with their studies.
Going off my class schedule, most of the days I need to come to school have only two periods at most, so I acquiesced right away to teach them when I have free time.
Having a study group in the library with friends does remind me of my university days.
Wait, everyone. How about you just look for the past exam questions?
Talking about clubs, I bounced off many invitations and decided to join the Magic Research Club.
It seems that in this club, students try to find an answer to the question of whether it’s possible to make magic accessible to everyone, like it was done with daily magic.
We are already in a school of magic, so it matches my goal; that’s why I chose this club.
It’s just that the club activities seem rather lax.
There aren’t any notices of what we will be doing, so I decided to just do my own thing too.
That’s how my life in the academy started, but… There’s a limit to how long I can spend all my free time at home in my room or at cafes, so I started to spend a lot of time in the office room Teal has borrowed for doing his work.
Lazing about on the high-quality sofa there feels great.
I do try and help with the work, but if I had to say, it feels like I’m just sorting out the things that aren’t related to Teal’s work.
Why does he need to direct how the budget for downtown roadwork is allocated?
This again made it clear to me that the capital’s management desperately needs an improvement in work efficiency. His coffee and tea aides should take up a little more work for themselves.
Anyway, even if the work Teal does now is considered part of his training for leading the country in the future, it’s not something he must tackle himself and collapse as a result.
Moreover, you can’t have a democracy without delegation of authority.
It’s not good to force all power into Teal’s hands since this country, the Karpf Theria Kingdom, is nowadays trying to make a smooth transition from the absolute monarchy to the constitutional monarchy.
I don’t really know anything about zoning or large-scale economic strategies for large cities, but if you want to fix the back roads of your house, why not make a civil engineering department to do this? Also, why not make the financial affairs department deal with requests for monetary assistance?
It’s possible that this school year’s life I have now will be filled with diligent sorting out of the work in place of Teal, who is only eager to help those who turn to him for help and who ends up taking on everything himself…
Well, I can spend time with him like this, and it’s better to think of this all as training for the work I will be doing when I become a crown princess in the future, I guess.
------------------ 
Chapter 102 – Oi, Teal! Let’s get that work efficiency improved at once!As today I don’t need to attend school classes, I dragged Teal to the capital’s parliament house with me.
In the Karpf Theria Kingdom, there are a House of Lords and a Citizens’ Assembly that decide national politics in a bicameral parliament system.
Unfortunately, the nobles are still quite influential, and the one who has a final say in deciding is the king, so while there are some movements to bring about democracy here, it’s still in large part a monarchy.
Even so, our Mirandiehl and the Karpf Tetra factions try to push laws for the citizens’ assembly to expand their political authority, and now, compared to the past, it has grown considerably.
In addition to national politics, each city has its own council, which is chaired in most parts by the lord of that territory who’s responsible for it, and each village’s mayor serves as a consultant to the governor as a representative for their village.
When I heard about this all during my education in my early days, I thought that the things here progressed quite a lot compared to what I was expecting.
I legit thought that all territories would have been ruled with an iron fist by their lords.
In practice, the main topics of discussion are this year’s taxes, petitions for conducting public work projects, where to get working hands for them, and other things, but in the end, at the present, everything is up to the discretion of a territory’s lord.
That in itself is not a problem now, as the collection of taxes is being reformed by the current king, which has resulted in the decline of unreasonable taxation.
Of course, as the free economy exists here, every noble, by advancing industries in their own territories, can get themselves more sources of income aside from taxes, as margin, in return for giving back money to the population through public investments and monster subjugations, is allowed to live in luxury.
At present, this country is surprisingly not corrupt.
“Hey, Miranda? Why do we need to attend the meeting with the capital’s citizens’ assembly today?”
“We are here for advance arrangements for reducing the work you do at the school by 90%.”
“Really?”
“You always take everything on yourself. When I sorted things out, your work lessened, right?”
“Yeah, thanks for that.”
“That’s why I made a call and gathered the citizens’ assembly to advance the delegation of authority and businesses’ stocktaking. Using the capital as a model case, we spread this to every provincial town and, as a result, will achieve the possibility of transferring power from a king to the citizenry.”
“You shouldn’t have that much authority, though.”
“I don’t, yes. When I consulted with Father, he seems to have talked with the Karpf Tetra duke, and then they immediately put this all together. It’s better to talk with the interested parties first. Having a backing is important.”
“Doing this kind of behind-the-scenes maneuvering, you have really become a proper noble lady, huh…”
Hearing the sound of a knock, it seems that the assembly’s executives we gathered for today have finally arrived.
“I will be supporting you here, Teal, as a future crown princess.”
“Yes, thanks for your help.”
Teal gave a signal, and the door opened.
We are now in the conference room in the Parliament House.
By the way, there are no electinos of any kind, so the ones who came are the guildmaster of the merchant’s guild, the guildmaster of the adventurer’s guild, and the three people from the factories’ guild.
After exchanging handshakes with Teal and greeting, everyone took a seat.
Okay, let’s get dangerous.
“Everyone, welcome, and thank you for coming. We are terribly sorry for taking time from your busy schedules, but for the future development of the capital, we would like to ask you to please lend us your strength and wisdom.”
Everyone, including Teal, looked at me like they saw a ghost or something.
They surely expected these words from Teal, not from me.
But if I leave everything up to him, he’s sure to try and take it on all by himself, so I decided to proceed with leading the meeting.
“I have already informed you all through a letter, but let me repeat here that we are considering the delegation of authority, since at present, the main problem that prevents the further development of the capital is the necessity of getting approval for any requested matter. At the moment, the citizens’ assembly does not have a right to say in deciding the budget. The castle… or rather, His Highness Dotteal, needs to review and give his approval for any request that must come through him; that’s how it is currently, so this makes people think, “Will my long-awaited request ever be undertaken if at all?” and the review process will often take more than one month or even longer.”
All guildmasters nodded at this.
Moreover, until the request comes to Teal’s table, it will need to be stamped by various officials, and this, overall, often takes around one or two months.
“That is why we are thinking of changing the system from needing approval from the palace for conducting projects related to urban development to where the royal palace will have to put in place the standards for each capital’s piece of land’s zoning, and for the actual buildings’ reconstruction, the roads and waterways maintenance will need to get approval from the capital’s parliament, and the country will be giving the budget for all of this.”
Giving Lisa a glance, who was waiting for orders, she spread out a list of paper.
“This is the map of the whole current capital. Until now, the issues were taken care of on a case-by-case basis. As you see, each district’s maintenance is not being conducted, and I am sure that every guildmaster present here knows about the problems with sanitation and public order in the slums in the northern part of the capital. That is why I propose this here.”
I asked Lisa to spread another list of paper.
That is the same map of the capital, only with everything roughly divided by color.
“The green part is the nobles’ block. As that is the castle’s town that has been used for a long time, we will leave it as is. The pink-colored part is mainly the housing district. We will turn it into a residential area, where we will forbid the construction of new factories and commercial facilities. Also, talking about factories, we must tighten our regulations concerning waste disposal. Recently, the smoke exhaust from factories in the capital was confirmed as a health hazard, which was made clear thanks to the research result that was conducted by ARLMCW. This is also supported by the complaints sent from the merchants’ guild. Continuing, the yellow-colored part is…”
This is like playing damn Sim City.
As I mentioned to Teal previously, I also talked about the construction of the public housing complex’s and related construction work before the parliament in the slums to the north, so I provided each guildmaster with the outline of this project.
“This is quite an appealing proposal, but does that mean we are free to construct buildings and factories that conform with the district’s regulations as long as we do business?”
“Yes, the country will be providing budget for public investments and servicing the roads and waterways, and all you’d need to do is make a request to the department of civil engineering. You are also free to build using our own funds. To start the construction work, you will need to notify the authorities that you want to do so. But as a result, you’d be removed from the management by the governance, and all work concerning maintenance and the like will be your own responsibility.”
Okay, the discussion seems like it will get quite heated.
Though Teal hasn’t said anything until now.
Is he alright?
------------------ 
Chapter 103 – Okaaaay! Teal, let’s go on a date! Let the others deal with the complicated stuff!For one hour afterwards, the discussion was very heated, but in the end, we mostly came to an agreement in general.
“Then, after the ministry of justice, the department of civil engineering, and the citizens’ assembly will tune the fine details, and with His Highness’ approval, we will reach the conclusion to this matter.”
“Understood. Thanks to the considerable weight given this time to the transfer of the deciding power to us, which, I think, is a very big step forward in giving the general populace the authority that was in the works for some time already. We cannot find words to express how grateful we are to you, Lady Mirandiehl.”
“Yes, the country cannot be successful if everything is left at the discretion of the nobility, which pushes their agendas. Then, please take care of the rest.”
When they were giving me polite bows, I noticed that Teal tugged at my sleeve.
“Eh, are you okay with this, Miranda?”
Must you whisper in my ear that fervently?! It tickles!
“The actual office staff will put everything in order. You’d only need to sign! And it’ll all be OK, no problemo! Well then, now excuse me for troubling you with this.”
Hell yeah! Let the others deal with all this shit!
Leaving the room together, I invited myself into Teal’s office room.
“Okay, after you sign the documents that will soon be completed and presented to you, the mountain of those papers will be 90% reduced, and we will be able to go out on dates whenever we can!”
“Ah, erm, yeah. Thanks?”
“Aren’t you happy?”
“No, I am happy, but… You are scary, Miranda.”
“What didya say?”
See, the Lords Earlgrey and Darjeen are smiling wryly.
Wait, you two are also at fault for not improving the work efficiency.
“Both of you, how about finding out if there is some unnecessary work here? Even if Teal says that he wants to spend time with me more, he won’t ever try to reduce the amount of work he does; that’s why I took everything in my hands this time.”
“Yes, we are truly ashamed of ourselves.”
Teal, with the help of them both, prepared the forms for request documents, but despite the number of departments it needs to go through, the one who gives the final decision hasn’t changed, and that’s why we are in this situation right now.
Probably, depending on the matter, every ministry and government office decided things themselves… though if it were done poorly, we could have ended up with the dictatorship here.
That’s the sure way to go backwards from what we have now…
There are a loooot of people better than you out there, so giving a general direction to the various departments should be okay, isn’t it?
If we can’t do this, society will be thrown into disarray and split in pieces in the end.
With that said, I took Teal with me to the garden to have tea there.
It’s been a while since we did this in the castle’s garden.
“I hope this all will make your life easier, Teal.”
“Yeah, thank you, Miranda… I got told that I would need to become a good king, and that’s why I ended up taking everything on myself in the end.”
“How about you look at me and learn how to pace yourself better, hm?”
“In your case, there are a lot of times when you just throw work at others, so I’m not sure you’re “pacing yourself” much there…”
Grrr. Well, I can’t deny this accusation.
It’s just that, thanks to doing that, I was able to make the cloth sanitary napkins, the absorbent cotton, and make progress in the gynecology.
I can’t really do shit with only knowledge… So yeah.
“Ahem. Well, with this, in about a month, we’ll achieve our first goal: taking classes together and going on dates after school, won’t we?”
“Yeah, that’s right. I feel that we can experience an ideal date soon.”
“Uh, well, I don’t know what you consider an ideal, Teal, but please keep the flirting in the school in moderation, okay?”
“Allow me at least a certain amount of closeness, will you?”
“Aye-aye…”
Eh, this much is okay, I guess. Having my head patted and being hugged at the waist feels pleasant, anyway.
Though being seen by people is embarrassing, as anyone can clearly see how red my face becomes at that time, I’d prefer not to go somewhere public.
Damn. I, too, want to pat Teal to death, but due to the height difference, it’s quite impossible…
Remember this after we get married.
------------------ 
Chapter 104 – Around half a year went byThe talks between the king and the citizens’ assembly have finished.
After that, the general framework was complete, and with the acknowledgement of the latter, both the royalists and left-wing nobles forced the aristocrats’ assembly to give their acknowledgement in the end.
It took a mere two months. Good, isn’t it?
Thanks to that, 70 percent of Teal’s work has vanished altogether.
70 percent! Seventy!
You know, it makes me wonder just where they found so much useless work to do.
At any rate, the capital is the capital, but, for the most part, the work consisted of dealing with permissions for stores to open branches or requests for construction works and the like.
Due to Teal’s weird sense of duty, he failed to assign the work to the tea and coffee bastards.
He had been like this forever, but did he really have that character trait of not being able to say no to those who asked him to help?
I was like this even in my previous life:
If you don’t understand it yourself, it’s better to just throw that work onto the specialists and not worry all that much. Yep.
Also, the debates at the specialized classes—astronomy, for example, which I signed up for—turned out to be quite heated.
Like, won’t we find not yet known planets by measuring the weight of every planet, the gravitational acceleration, and the orbital period? Or something.
And there I am, a duke’s daughter, who has turned into someone who is only good at talking despite not being able to do calculations for shit.
But for some reason, it seems that the teachers were very spirited by my words and, taking them as a starting point, continued to progress the research.
Good for you, I guess… Thanks to you, my exam questions have become even harder.
Talking about the magic lessons, I was able to achieve a certain power in the casting of the basic Fire and Water magics.
Should I say “fuck yeah”?
By the way, I have already mastered intermediate-level Wind magic.
So this is the difference in the affinity for an attribute, huh…
Like in a certain RPG, it’s usable, but the damage is low, just like my Fire and Water magic are now.
And also, I have become able to use that basic magic thanks to the Magic Research Club.
Its president, a viscount’s daughter called Riselle Anaham, who’s a year older than me, has a dream that goes like this: “I’d like everyone to be able to use magic of all attributes.”
However you look at it, my mana capacity is quite large. I joined the research by helping her with the experiments.
Basically, Lady Riselle provides me with a spell, and I try to use it to cast magic.
Sometimes we suffer failures where I lose quite a bit of my mana, and it’s all quite difficult, but, surprisingly, I felt like my capacity grew even larger as a result.
So you can train your mana capacity, huh… It was the first time I learned about it.
When I asked grandpa-teacher about it, he told me that it’s common knowledge, but as I didn’t have a lot of opportunities to use magic, I haven’t been able to train myself in this way.
Though I can’t really train magic until exhaustion every day like that, or I won’t be able to go to school…
Okay, so with Teal getting more free time, he ended up clinging to me quite often.
It’s not like I mind it, but sometimes it gets to the point where I can’t really move around much.
Using the height difference to his advantage, he lays my head on his lap, strokes my head, sniffs my nape, or grips me close by the waist.
I did end up yelling, “Am I a cat to you or what?”
What’s more, he even wants to do this in the school cafeteria!
Stop! Let’s at least do it where no one sees us!
No, this is in itself a problem, though… Just the other day, I was almost dragged by him to the roof…
What are you, Teal? When did you turn into a mass of lust?
How about you stop doing things for which the older male students admire you one after another? It’s extremely embarrassing.
Well, I don’t really hate doing it, so whatever, I guess.
I do like being stroked and patted, anyway… Ahem.
And so, after getting through the caping test without problem and successfully completing half a year’s exams, the summer vacation has finally arrived.
Teal, who now has a lot of leeway from work, suggested that we go on a trip together, and it was decided that I would go for the first time to our territory for a visit.
Though I thought it’s not good for me, who only knows about the Mirandiehl territory through documents, to go there.
Well, I am still looking forward to the trip.
------------------ 
Chapter 105 – Mirandiehl territory, here I come!Counting the time to go there and return, it takes around 15 days, so I am currently preparing for the trip.
Five days to arrive, five days in the capital town, and five days to return.
On paper, the plan is for Teal to go there to do an inspection of the duke’s lands and to sign the trade agreement with the Moulinie Kingdom on the other side of the sea.
I will also be present there.
Eh, man, what can ya do, eh, when the biggest fella out the, the king himself is askin’ ya to accompany the crown prince as his fiancee, ya know?
Moreover, from the Moulinie Kingdom, the crown prince’s wife will be coming.
Well, the other party is already 25, though. More than a 10-year difference is nothing to sneeze at.
Won’t we both be seen as mere kids, eh? Me, specifically.
Now then, with the help of the maids, I was stuffed in a light and appropriate one-piece dress for my status.
Since now is summer, wearing that dress helps keep things refreshing, but when we will be meeting the neighboring country’s royalty, I’d need to dress in a fully specced evening dress… Well, it’s not very revealing.
It seems that Teal has designed it himself, as he didn’t want anyone to see my skin as much as possible, and that’s why that dress covers even the neck.
What’s more, I thought it was a one-piece, but it turned out to be a three-piece. The skirt is different. Underneath it, there will be long pants.
Even without the skirt, it still works as proper clothing, see? Isn’t it cool?
What devil possessed you to come up with such an eccentric design? When I said that, Miss Rui told me that ladies generally do the same.
Is that so?
“I came for you, Miranda.”
“Thanks, Teal.”
He came to pick me up.
Today I was meeting him with my mother.
“I see my little Miranda is loved. Your Highness, please take good care of my daughter.”
“Yes, leave it to me.”
Okay, let’s get into the carriage together.
During the next five days of riding in it, we will be stopping at the towns and villages on the way.
There won’t be any problems, as the territories we will be staying in are the ones under the direct supervision of the capital or our own Mirandiehl lands.
The towns and villages on the way are managed by the baron and viscount lords of our faction, who will be serving as our hosts at their mansions. So it’s safe.
We probably won’t encounter any monsters or bandits there.
If anything, I’d really like to. I could have smashed them with my magic. Sigh.
By the way, during these past six months, I’ve blabbered to Brother Tosted some vague half-truths, and that led to the development of the railways.
I wondered then: won’t we be able to make something even more practical easily using the already existing steam engines and Fire and Water mangic?
When we went together with Teal to that technology exhibition, I saw there a prototype steam locomotive (more like a car) and thought, “Were they able to accomplish such a thing already?”
From the perspective of a technology under development, its effectiveness was quite bad, but with the future advancement in mind, it could be good to invest in it, so I pushed for laying the rails for its use.
With Brother’s quick research, he sent a petition to the government, so now at the side of the road leading to the home we are now going to, the construction work of the railway equipment is being done.
“In a couple of years, people would be able to go to Mirandiehl territory by rail.”
“That’s true. It’s a cutting-edge development of this period.”
The roads inside the capital have already been paved and are not shaky at all, but once you leave them, the carriage starts to shake a little.
But this is fun and pleasant shaking.
So I wanna sleep.
“You can go ahead; I’ll lend you my lap.”
“I know you just want to tease me with your headpats, you scoundrel.”
“Fufufu. It’s really fun to cherish a cutie.”
“What? Did you awaken to a new fetish or something?”
Well, there is nothing I can do here. Do what you want with me; I don’t mind.
But I am not saying it’s okay to land your hands on me. Do this only after we are married.
And anyway, I am confident that I’ll fall asleep after having my head stroked. No, I will fall asleep.
Just by sleeping a little, I am sure we will arrive by the time I wake up.
------------------ 
Chapter 106 – A date basking in the evening sunWe arrived at the first town.
This place is one of the defense locations under the direct supervision of the crown.
That’s why we will be staying in the fort here today.
Also, if you return a little, you’ll see the Air Force base.
The person who’s managing here is the Marquess Schutted from our faction. He’s the father of Lady Margaret.
“I welcome you to my humble abode. Miss Mirandiehl, thank you very much for always being a good friend to my daughter.”
“I am too, very thankful for her friendship… But, marquess, is Lady Margaret’s money alright?”
She’s still one of our big customers, after all.
Whenever a new product comes out, she’ll definitely buy it, and most of those things aren’t cheap, so I’m worried for her.
“You do not have to worry about it, as my daughter is very levelheaded. Nevertheless, I am thankful for your thoughtfulness.”
Is that so? Well, I haven’t heard anything about her having problems with her budget, so I guess it’s not that big of a deal.
“Then, let me guide you both to your rooms.”
We were separated by gender, as it was.
No surprises there, as while we are betrothed to each other, the marriage is still way off.
I should mention that the sanitary products were a great success.
To tell you the truth, I wondered if I’d manage, as I had the monthly coming this week. But thanks to the continuous improvement, the cloth napkins have only become better.
Unfortunately, I can’t wash them during this trip, so they’ll be one-time use for now… Well, they are expensive, so I’ll hold onto them for a little while.
Ah, but moving around is easy now… It’s good when your problems just fade away.
Also, there’s a new female underwear developed.
Thanks to the investigation by the ARLMCW, the impact on the body of wearing a corset was found, and at the same time, the brassiere was being developed.
So using a corset to change the shape of your body is now starting to be considered outdated.
After all, following my Mother’s example, all aristocratic women have started giving up on using it little by little.
Though the brassieres of today are a little different than the modern ones.
You need to use a string to tighten it up instead of using the clasp that will hold it together.
Eh, I’m sure it will advance more in the future.
This is all thanks to the research laboratory for the advancement of the health care of women and the consequent understanding of the usual nobles’ illnesses through seeing the differences in the lives commoners and nobles lead.
The use of a corset is one of them.
Well, of course, it is bad for your body… It’s good if you just use it as it is, but most people try to squeeze themselves into them, bringing them almost to death.
That aside, I felt that the room where I’ll be staying was quite cozy, despite it being a room for a noble.
Well, what can you do since this was originally a fort?
Leaving and placing my luggage where I needed it, I was called by Teal and went to the fort’s roof.
“When you look at the capital from here, you can see it all, and the scenery is very calming.”
“Ohhh, you are right. That’s beautiful, alright.”
The capital basking in the evening sun is quite a picturesque sight.
The castle standing right in the middle of it is sure pretty.
Seeing it from far away, every ministry’s towers are sticking out all over the place.
Looking at it like this, you can’t help but think, “Yeah, this is sure another world.”
“It’s another world.”
“It sure is another world.”
We both sigh in contentment.
Culturally, this place shares a lot of similarities with Earth, and looking at the advancement of technology, it feels like in the future it will turn out the same as it’s in our world, but sometimes there are a lot of peculiarities in buildings and works of art, and you can’t forget about magic’s existence.
If one tries harder, with effort, you’d be able to use magic to fly through the skies… Should I try to do it while we travel and I have free time?
“Who could have thought that we would be together even in this other world.”
“Honestly. That’s what you’d call being stuck with each other for life.”
“Hahaha, probably.”
We weren’t able to be together in the previous world, but we will be together in this one, so that expression is certainly on the money.
I try to softly take Teal’s hand.
“What is it?”
“Well, it’s good to do this sometimes.”
“Yeah.”
Yep, even without flirting, holding each other’s hand is a great feeling in and of itself.
Right, Teal?
You rascal, in the past life, you didn’t allow me to pat your head off, but you sure like to do this to me… I won’t forgive you that easily, so prepare yourself.
------------------ 
Chapter 107 – We arrived at the territoryFive days after we headed out, we are finally getting close to the capital town today.
Since it’s facing the sea, you could call it the country’s border’s edge in a sense.
And hey, this is the first time I’ve experienced a sea breeze since coming to this world.
“Teal, have you seen the sea?”
“Yes, I have. It was at Arkrays, though. There was a Navy base I visited.”
“Now I remember it… Did you go to see the ships of the line?”
“Yeah, they were in the middle of building a steamship.”
“Who’s the one that proposed that advanced thing?”
“I provided them with my written proposal. If I didn’t do something, you’d surely try your hand at making a paddle steamer or something… And hey, didn’t you already speak with the net duke about having a private boat?”
“Yes, that’s right. I am sorry, like for real.”
“It looks to me that you are the one who’s trying to do much work by herself, though…”
“I can’t be held responsible for that, so I just dumped it on those who’re savvy about this kinda thing.”
“That’s what makes you so incredible…”
We continue to talk, sitting side by side inside the carriage.
There’s nobody to overhear us, so we can talk at our leisure.
As this royal carriage has a lot of improvements and the earth here is quite hardened, the road is smooth and there’s almost no shaking.
And since the soundproofing here is good, the clattering sound is almost pleasant to the ears instead of grating.
Just listening to it makes one sleepy, so if we aren’t talking, sleep will overtake us.
It’s the same energy as riding on the train.
“Oh yeah. Teal, I’m bored; let’s play cards.”
“Okay, but what can we play with only us?”
“Blackjack.”
“Okay, so what are the stakes?”
“Let me see… Whoever wins gets to pat the other on the head.”
“Yeah, you’re on! Your hair is silky smooth and feels pleasant; I really want to mess it up badly.”
“Hey, stop it.”
By the way, this world doesn’t have the Othello game.
There are chess and card games, though.
Also, when you go to a casino, you can not only play poker or blackjack there, but you can even enjoy playing roulette, it seems.
Eh? This country had horse racing, hadn’t it? I haven’t seen it, though.
“Hey, Teal, how about horse racing? Did you do it? And yeah, I got 20, so it’s my win.”
“Geh, you got me there. I didn’t do it myself and only went to look, since the palace hosts one.”
I do a pat-pat as a reward.
“Now that I think about it, the Karpf Theria Cup, there was such a thing… There were also the Arkray Cup and the Saintgeorges Cup, right?”
“There’s no Mirandiehl Cup, huh?”
“It seems we aren’t interested in horses. I heard the yacht race is popular instead.”
“That sure feels like a big deal.”
“It’s one of the entertainments for gamblers.”
Since there’s no TV or radio, when you talk about entertainment, nobles go to opera houses, see theater plays, and visit concerts; the common citizens usually enjoy the performances of traveling troupes or street theater plays.
So, spending plenty of money on games counts as top-class entertainment for gamblers.
There are also places like gambling houses similar to casinos, and some of the latter are even under government management.
If you want to have a good time, they are the best in security. Though their rates are very steep.
Some careless citizens play card games in taverns and even in seedy gambling dens.
If one does something unscrupulous, the citizens’ assembly will call upon the recently formed police organization made up of the royal guards, who have undergone structural reorganization, to crack down on them.
The country does recognize gambling as a form of entertainment, but the businesses that allow more than the usual bets that are higher than the standard rate are shut down very fast.
Well, in most cases, those doing it are more likely those who are laundering the illegal money, and quite a lot of raids on their houses find a lot of money stashed there.
Moreover, the police organization was the result of my proposed military reforms.
Since the army is responsible for the national defense, and after explaining the dangers of the army being in charge of supporting the people’s daily lives, it was made into an independent organization.
Even if only the guards were used, the military is still overequipped for dealing with civilian crimes.
The maintenance costs are big, too.
Even just by using the already existing framework, reorganizing it after revision for their role, and providing equipment, the budget was sucked completely dry.
The education and upkeep costs take quite a lot of money that was needed to be spent on them, it seems.
No wonder. The guards operate on the on-duty system and are usually stationed at the gaurdrooms, and as they serve in the army, they all have received military training.
I feel that we are one step closer to the proper constitutional state now.
When Teal becomes king, it would be good if the country ended up being a proper constitutional monarchy.
Some parts of it are already reminiscent of that, as there are laws that limit the authority of the king.
But on the other hand, there are still a lot of things that require the king’s consent; in some ways, it still reminds me of an absolute monarchy.
I’d like to have universal suffrage in the future, and, while I’m not sure which, I’d like to have either the prime minister or the president of the parliament approved by a king.
If we don’t push democratization, the nobles’ abilities will be rated highly, and we will be left in the dust of a rapidly changing society.
The other countries, it seems, have already started on this path, so I want us to learn from their example and reform, and when I become the queen, my work will become easier. That’s what I hope for, anyway.
After doing this and that, having both patted Teal and being patted myself, we finally arrived at our destination.
Going through the not-that-high walls, when we entered, we were greeted by the citizens there.
It seems like a notice of our arrival has been issued here.
The people crowded the sidewalks to take a peek at us.
This is sure lively here.
“The merryness here is a different sight compared to the capital.”
“Yes, I am here for the first time, so it’s quite refreshing. You can also feel the salt breeze.”
“Thanks to the sea here.”
“Yeah.”
We proceeded in the moving carriage, waving our hands at the people.
Hey, the roads here are paved with concrete, too.
If so, aren’t some of the buildings here built with it as well? Feels like it.
Maybe, due to the sea wind, the wooden buildings aren’t that useful.
The sand here is mixed with salt, and I hope that it won’t lead to corrosion…
Ten minutes after entering, we have arrived at the mansion.
Big Brother has welcomed us, and our five-day trip here came to an end.
As it’s my first time in the Mirandiehl territory, I’ll try to enjoy myself as much as I can aside from doing official business.
And I wanna go to the sea!
Actually, this time I have sneakily brought a ball, so I want to play something together with Teal while we are here.
------------------ 
Chapter 108 – The dinner is so tasty!Arriving at the town’s mansion, Brother Tosted and others welcomed us.
To be exact, they were my brother, Lady Sasha, and several servants.
“We welcome you in our humble home, Your Highness. Miranda, how were you?”
Getting off the carriage with Teal’s help, I was immediately held up in the air.
“Brother!!! I am quite alright, so please stop with this foolishness!”
“Hahaha! You grew up so much.”
“We saw each other barely half a year ago!”
Lady Sasha, please don’t look at me with that face barely containing your mirth! Teal, help!
When people easily lift me up by putting their hands under my armpits, it makes me worry that I haven’t grown much, if at all!
It also gives me a weird feeling to be held up by a brother who looks like a tall older sister with his feminine face, though not on the level of Teal’s.
It makes me want to put eyeliner on your face.
“Your Highness, tonight we will be treating you to fish dishes we are proud of in our land. We will call you when the food is ready, so for now, let us guide you to the room you will be staying in.”
I was finally put down on the ground.
The mansion’s size was similar to that in the capital, but the expanse of the garden was on another level entirely.
No end to the property is in sight.
The room we were guided to had a great view of the garden, and between the Teal’s and mine bedrooms, there was a lounge-like space for resting.
As far as Brother has explained, it was originally a room reserved specifically for married noble guests.
Teal, know this: I won’t allow sneaking into my bedroom at night.
The door leading to it has three locks placed on it, to boot.
What’s more, it’s the type where there are no keyholes, so I don’t think it’s easy to unlock it.
What scary security they have here.
That said, now we were having tea in the lounge.
“As tomorrow is Sunday, we don’t have anything planned, so we’ll go on a date under the pretext of exploring the territory, and from Monday to Tuesday, we will be holding trade negotiations and the banquet afterwards. Wednesday is a free day, and on Thursday, we will be doing an official inspection, and finally, on Friday, we are going to return home.”
“I heard about the schedule beforehand, but it really is quite hectic.”
“What can you do? We are on an official business trip, after all.”
“But the talks have already been finished, and we only need to attend the signing ceremony, right?”
“Yeah, the contents were reviewed by the official that came with us, so it won’t be anything stressful.”
“Then, okay.”
With a light knock, the mansion’s maid has called out to us.
The dinner is ready, it seems.
“Let’s go, Teal.”
“I can’t wait to taste the fish dishes.”
“Don’t they serve it in the palace?”
“I haven’t yet ate the fresh fish one.”
“Is that so?”
The fish served in the capital is either dried or salted, so of course it’s a high-class product.
The raw fish barely lasts a day, so even in the Mirandiehl territory, you can only get something that could be brought by carriage under a day at most.
And of course, nobody would eat fish raw.
You can’t be sure if there aren’t any parasites in it.
“It would be great if this would suit your palate, Your Highness, and here, we have quite a selection of fish dishes available. Marinated and steamed, fritted, and we also have paella.”
“We can eat paella here?”
That’s right, in our territory, people can eat paella for some reason.
As you can’t eat freshly picked seafood there, in the capital’s home, we were only served paella with meat.
Furthermore, nobles don’t usually eat rice.
Bread is more common.
“Yes, here we have not only wheat, but our people also often dine with rice.”
“Oh, it’s been awhile since I had it.”
“My, did you really eat rice sometime before, Your Highness?”
Teal, your eyes are swimming. You just got up and blabbed about the memories of your past life there.
“Hm? Ahhh, it was a long time ago when I learned about how the common citizens live their lives.”
“That so? If you were paying close attention to such things, we, as your humble vassals, could be assured of the future.”
Brother acts all impressed, but I’m sure that half of Teal’s words just now were a lie.
I think that the point of observing citizens’ lives in the town is true, but rice dishes in the capital? Get real.
“Yes, it’s good!”
From the start of the dinner, Teal was very excited.
The live fish was prepared right on the spot; its meat was plump and tender with a lot of fat, and paella and seafood dashi all came out superb and very tasty.
It’s frustrating that we can’t eat it raw, but oysters! Yes, oysters—those we could eat as is.
That shit just rocks!
Of course, you can’t help yourself from eating way beyond your capacity, so I stopped at two, but Teal managed to gulp down four.
Are you alright?
“I was very satisfied, Count Tosted.”
“I am pleased to hear that. One cannot eat oysters in the capital, so were you surprised at seeing them?”
“The rich seashore flavor and its creamy texture were quite exceptional.”
“Tomorrow’s breakfast will have clam chowder served, so wait for it.”
“Yes, I agree. If I’m not careful with enjoying the food while I am here, I can see myself getting fat.”
“Teal, please don’t become fat. I’d not like that.”
I’ll tease you to death otherwise.
“Yeah, I’ll be careful.”
Do you really understand, eh? Truly?
You were very excited there, more than usual… Will it really be okay?
------------------ 
Chapter 109 – It’s the seeeeeeeeaThe sea.
We came to the sea.
It’s so blue… I feel like my image of the stale green sea is being washed away.
The sea that hasn’t been polluted by humans is indeed beautiful.
“I legit thought that swimsuits had been invented here.”
“Did you just wake up or something? I can’t show my skin in public here.”
“But see, you have already brought to the world the Miranda Bunny suit.”
“This and that are different things. I am not a stupid girl. Moreover, in this era, swimsuits are just the clothes that don’t become transparent when wet, right? Do you want to see them?”
“Nah… I’m fine.”
“Why do you become manly only in weird places like these, Teal?”
“To tell you the truth, I can’t bear not seeing your cuteness, Miranda.”
“Stop messing up my hair, already.”
Don’t pat my head whenever you get an opportunity. See, as I said, my hair is a mess!
Our flirting with each other continues today as well.
Now, if you’re wondering why we came to the sea, that would be to gather shells.
I am now wearing clothes that can be dirtied without worry and that are easy to move in.
That’s why today I wear high-waisted pants with rolled-up legs.
As a result, I ended up looking like a princess of a fallen country who was sheltered by air pirates from somewhere.
There are only two guards with us today, so the date promises to be very relaxed.
That said, thanks to Brother’s maneuvering, we were able to have the beach and the tidal flat for ourselves, so I’m sure there are more guards stationed somewhere in the distance.
“Here we are, the buckets and rakes. Our goal is the quahog and manila clam. Let’s aim to have the clam chowder!”
“I see, that’s why we have these tools here with us… And wait, what are you making the prince do?”
“It’s a date, so you gotta help.”
“Well, okay… But you really like sea creatures, huh…”
“Yes. I wanna squeeze sea cucumbers, throw starfish around, and catch a crab.”
“Please stop with the throwing and people scaring, okay?
“Wharf roach.”
“Let’s stop you right there.”
Damn, my mouth was shut.
Well, it’s not like I really want to encounter them, but if there are, then I can’t do anything with that.
For now, let’s just turn the sand on the beach over and search.
Oh, there is a hole in the sand; it’s probably in there.
I found a lot of various large and small bivalves.
It’s probably clams and hard clam shells. Their outer shells were sturdier than those of common clams.
“You’ve found quite a bit of it.”
“Let’s bring the small ones back where we took them.”
Next, we were headed to the rocky area, looking for mussels. And crabs.
Today I’m wearing non-heeled leather shoes that smack as I walk, so even if the foothold is bad, it’s okay.
The cuffs of my trousers have become a little wet, but Teal dried them for me.
So you can use the Fire magic in this way, eh? I didn’t know.
Also, recently, Teal accompanies me at the lessons for every attribute, so he turned out to be very useful as a one-person dryer.
He’s better than me at using magic, boo-hoo!
“Hah, I want to be able to use all attributes like you, Teal.”
“If you accomplish that, what are you going to do?”
“For now, I just want to make use of them. Isn’t it kinda cool?”
“Yeah, well, it’s just like you to do this, Miranda.”
Innit?
I was able to find a crab and a mussel in the rocky tract.
I ended up taking the crab back.
I’m satisfied with just observing.
A small one won’t be much of a food anyway.
Also, starfish and sea cucumbers were found.
There was some kind of fugu I saw, but of course I didn’t touch it.
Its movements were sluggish, and it was easy to catch, but you can’t know for sure what it was.
If that thing had poisonous mucus, I could have died touching it.
“Mwhuhu. I caught so much of everything!”
“I look forward to a luxurious clam chowder that will come out of them.”
“Also, the mussels could be steamed in wine.”
“It makes you want to drink.”
“We can’t drink yet, though.”
“That’s what frustrates me.”
I agree with him on this point.
Teal, I really wanna eat something tasty and have a drink with you soon.
------------------ 
Chapter 110 – The results of doing various official businessesWe enjoyed ourselves quite a lot, but our original purpose in coming here was a business trip.
The next day after our shell gathering date, we switched on full work mode.
All for putting into effect the new trade treaty with our neighboring Moulinie Kingdom across the sea.
Well, it’s all about an agreement on free trade and a reduction of tariffs on imports.
After the signing ceremony, an informal get-together will be held.
As we are both underage, there won’t be a banquet.
At the gathering, aside from us, there will be merchants responsible for marine transport and other related nobles in attendance.
Just where did they all crawl out of? There are so many people, you can’t help but ask this.
Moreover, the venue will not be the Mirandiehl mansion but a separately built conference room for diplomatic relations.
When did they build it? It’s even bigger than the one in the capital.
On the second floor of the building, there are a lot of areas and halls for doing high-level business negotiations, so, naturally, we went there.
It seems that this is a prototype, and later, when the same will be built in the capital, the information and feedback gathered will serve as a basis for future expansion.
Are you not throwing quite a lot of money at all this, huh?
On the last day of our stay at the Mirandiehl territory, I was sentenced by my brother to being dragged about the whole town.
And I don’t mean this in the sense of being strapped to a carriage and being dragged like that, you know?
Well, I did have a strict schedule of going to famous places of interest one after another, though.
I was so freaking hella tired afterwards.
All that time, Teal had a smile threatening to burst out on his face when waving to citizens here; this clearly showed the difference in our experience in dealing with this, even if he had only two years more than me.
During the queen’s education, I haven’t heard about this at all… Damn, remembering memories of my past life, I know that when doing this kind of work, the great people always did it with a smile on their faces… This is my future work, so I gotta just get used to it, I guess.
“This is your first time doing public business for so long, yeah?”
“That’s right… It’s my first time doing things that aren’t sympathy calls to churches or orphanages, and smiling for a prolonged time is a first for me.”
“Great work.”
“You’re so used to this, Teal.”
“Right, I can hold this plastered smile for ages.”
“Ahhh, I see. If only I had done that, it would have been good… I learned about that in my lessons.”
“Did you forget that?”
“Absolutely. Now, thinking about it, I can do the same smile if I try.”
I really thought that this was the face one should make during a war of words between nobles.
So should I do the same here too, I wonder?
“But despite you usually being so cheerful, just how can you make it so that your expression doesn’t change when you feign friendliness? I think that’s amazing.”
“Teal, you need to train your face muscles more.”
“I don’t think I should go as far as you.”
“Eh, probably.”
Right now, we are enjoying our break by drinking tea after dinner at the Mirandiehl mansion.
The moon in the night sky outside shines ever so brilliantly.
“I gotta admit, I was very weirded out when seeing the way the Moulinie Kingdom side was insisting on wanting to buy underwear and sanitary products.”
“Well, the rumor mill is a scary thing. It was quite a bombshell invention you brought into the world, after all.”
“Hey, Teal, don’t forget that you are equally guilty of doing the same.”
“Hah. Is this what people call a cheat of knowledge, eh?”
“But we didn’t do anything ourselves.”
“Didn’t you briefly mention wanting the things you made?”
“I really am not responsible for underwear, though.”
“You can’t say the same about the absorbent cotton and cloth napkins, can you?”
“I didn’t say anything more than if you want it to repel fat, you should make it absorbent, that is all!”
Truthfully, that was as far as my knowledge went.
And what I know from the education I got in my past life is only the basics.
And really, in the fields I am not skilled in, I can’t proudly say that I’m wiser than a mere fifth grader.
“Wait, aren’t you, who does a financial reform more of a cheater?”
“But even then, I just told them the outline, and the one who did that is the Ministry of Finance.”
“Ehhh?! How weird. Teal did not take all the work on himself for a change?”
“What can a mere bank teller do in such a situation?”
“That’s true… Still, you’re quite a workaholic.”
“I just can’t refuse when people ask me…”
“If you do this as a king, death from stress awaits you.”
“You are absolutely right.”
After we hit the sack and have breakfast tomorrow, we will be returning home.
This was quite a fun summer vacation.
------------------ 
Chapter 111 – Trying to find a method… for Miranda to fly in the skyWith the end of the holidays, school started again.
I am in class A, even in the second semester.
Also, during the first semester, I was able to get half of the specialized subjects credits needed for graduation qualifications.
Let’s be more laidback in attending the lessons from now on.
As one of the duties of attending the school for nobles, I meet with various nobles and merchants of the same age, and after being taught by Lady Tolastina how to use the salon, I intend to spend quite a lot of time mingling at the tea parties.
I also continue researching magic with Lady Riselle.
Should I make my graduation thesis based on that, I wonder?
Magic research is a possible theme for it.
Going into the second semester, we have started learning advanced magic, and as a result of studying grimoires, I started wondering if I couldn’t create my own original spells.
They will be limited to Wind magic, but I would be able to use the magic not written about in the textbooks that way.
Like the magic Teal used for drying my clothes.
That bastard just went and became proficient in the use of the advanced magic of all attributes before me.
Just what you’d expect from a royal lineage…
So, Wind magic is the magic that you can use to cause whirlwinds to swirl or blast gusts of it around.
The more advanced one even makes it possible to tinker with the atmospheric density.
With the sufficient amount of vacuum in the space, you can even generate shock waves.
Doing that, it’s possible to control the “air flow,” and I wondered if I could fly in the sky with that.
Attitude control and propulsion could all be substituted by Wind magic and make one able to fly.
By fixing the coordinates of the source and the body position, and by utilizing the concept of a jet engine sucking and compressing air that is heated and its increased volume burst forth, the larger volume of spat-out air than there was previously, you can produce sufficient propulsion.
As for the attitude control, you want the body’s center of gravity pushed by the propulsion, so by applying the magic around both of your arms and changing the direction of your hands, you can fly through the skies above. I put this into practice as soon as I thought about it.
By the way, I once saw a video of someone applying this principle by attaching to both their hands two radio-controlled jet engines.
That’s my inspiration!
The problem is that while flying, your hands aren’t available for doing other things, and this is inconvenient.
Well, for now, flying in the sky is enough.
I am now at the Magic Research Club’s training range, practicing the magic I thought up.
Spread the arms first… This almost looks like the threatening pose a tamandua does.
Then, deploying the magic, I use its output to fly up.
Little by little, the thundering sound grows louder.
As there are no revolving parts, no HF sounds are heard, but the sound of whistling wind sure is annoying.
With the increase in pressing feel on both my arms, I gradually lowered them.
Wait. Do I need to support my body with arms or else?
Let’s reinforce my body a little.
I put up strengthening magic on my upper body.
Any error would be fatal.
Lowering my arms, the body flies higher and higher.
This is a balance point; if I lower my arms even more, my body should fly up.
I lowered them even more cautiously now.
Hm, it’s quite shaky…
Currently, each arm creates airflow around its axis, but the balance is somewhat off.
Come to think about it, that guy used two engines on each arm and placed them on the front and back.
So I can’t really take a proper balanced orientation like this?
Sure, having four points instead of two helps with that.
I quickly split the direction of the airflow output between the front and back.
Oh, now it’s balanced.
I can fly higher like this.
At the same time as I lowered my arms, my body slowly soared.
You know, keeping the balance of the body itself is very difficult.
If I continue with this current position of arms, I will rise at a constant speed.
Eh? Aren’t I wearing a skirt right now?
I noticed it when I rose above the peak of a tree here, but it was already late.
The very loud noise accompanied me from the start, and the students from other clubs looked at me.
I want to think that since nobody came right under me, none of the people here saw it.
Though the skirk flaps quite spectacularly… I probably made an error in choosing garments.
For now, I was able to achieve lift, so I slowly descended.
If I drop right now, it will be bad. Let’s proceed with caution.
As I finished my shaking landing, Teal came up to me.
“Miranda! I understand that you do an experiment, but I forbid you doing it in your uniform!!!”
I was harshly scolded.
But I surely felt his gentleness in not forbidding me from flying itself.
Yep, next time I’ll wear trousers…
------------------ 
Chapter 112 – This time I will be flying freelyI got scolded aplenty after floating in the air while wearing a skirt.
Also, since a lot of people until now have tried flight magic and failed, which led to this field being considered a failure, I was called up to an Air Force base due to my success.
Well, the place there is quite big, and there’s almost no possibility of someone seeing me like it was at the school, so I guess it’s good.
Though, won’t dragons be scared due to the loud noise I produce while flying?
“S, So, thanks to Teal’s mediation, I am now able to practice my magic in that spacious place.”
“Yeah, that’s not a skill you can train while being seen by others, in my opinion.”
“But that magic, if you cannot use advanced Wind magics, isn’t usable, right?”
“No, if you make that spell into a magic tool, anyone will become able to fly by using it, though.”
“Oh, ohhh… Wow, then I decided what to do for my graduation paper. I’ll consult with Chris.”
“Well, that’s only if you succeed…”
“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely make it work.”
To deal with the problems found in my first test, I decided to attach tubes to both my hands to fix the points of airflow emergence.
I also placed one on my back.
Using only arms doesn’t really make it stable, so the main propulsion will be on the back, and tubes on the arms will help with balance and control of direction. I think it will work.
Drones usually have four or more points of thrust generation, which is good, but this time, I have only three, which I thought was enough to fly more easily than before.
Besides, this time, mobility is more important than stability.
“Now, let’s start.”
Now, there are no public or unrelated people, and only those from the Air Force are present.
That’s why today I borrowed the military uniform of the AF.
I am wearing proper trousers.
The loud noise has started to go off.
It certainly is a bother… But fortunately, I prepared earplugs today.
With the tube in a fixed position on my back and on my hands, this time the control is easy.
I can support my body now, not only with my arms like before.
Slightly bending myself forward, I increase output and gently fly up.
Okay, now I can spread my arms to the sides and correct the altitude, and when I want to propel forward, I just need to place my arms behind me, and for stopping, I’d place them before me.
Yep, as I have flown up, now I just need to move as I please.
“I’m offfffff!!!”
Nobody can hear me anyway.
Since everyone here has plugged their ears.
The problem with using this magic for flying in the sky is definitely its loud noise.
The compressed air that is expanded by using Fire magic is what helps with getting propulsion on its release, so you can say this state is similar to blasting explosions one after another.
Despite it not being very hot, it still spews considerably heated air out.
Truthfully, if one is hit by it, the possibility of getting a burn is very high.
“Oh, it’s flying; it’s flying.”
The people on the ground seem to be clapping.
That’s because I’m flying at an abnormally high speed, even if it’s with a loud noise.
It’s comparable to a dragon in flight.
But will the body hold? That’s the question… If I place a defense wall before myself like a windbreak, I guess it will help somewhat.
And wait, maybe thanks to the auxiliary engines, it doesn’t take a lot of mana compared to before… Let’s try to see how long I’ll be able to fly.
By changing my posture by bending forward, I gain speed.
Capital, here I come!
How long will it take to get to the capital, which’s quite a long way from here if riding by horse-drawn carriage?
Everyone down on the ground is shouting something, but I don’t care.
The noise will probably cause an uproar, but unlike a dragon, no one will understand what this small figure of mine is.
Oh, in five minutes, I got close to the castle.
This is the place where the Magic Knights Order is stationed… Ah, our eyes met.
Sorry, I can’t wave to you. What with my equipment and all.
After flying around the capital once, I returned to the Air Force base.
“Man, it was so fun.”
“Miranda… I bet everyone in the capital is now panicking… We heard the sound of your flying all the way here.”
“Really? I did increase the output, but to think it was that loud.”
While talking with Teal, a runner came up to us.
“Emergency message!!! In the skies of the capital, an unidentified flying object was spotted emitting a very loud noise! Air Force, dispatch immediately!”
Ah, Count Freima is holding his head in his arms…
“Miranda. You will write a letter of apology, right?”
“Ugeh. Ahahaha.”
Damn, it turned into a very serious matter, hah…
------------------ 
Chapter 113 – Reflecting and future challengesI got way ahead of myself.
Hello, it’s Miranda Mirandiehl.
Yes, I ended up writing a mountain of apology letters.
To the Air Force, to the Ministry of Magic, to the Ministry of Justice, to the royal family, to the citizens’ assembly…
Not only did AF send a quick report to the royal family explaining that the cause of the roaring UFO incident was me, but there were quite a lot of eyewitnesses. As such, Teal also got involved, and I went to every department hat in hand, after what I was scribbling and scrawling on a bunch of paper for my formal apology.
That’s what happens when you act before you think…
Though not only the Air Force, but the Magic Knights Order and army got interested and demanded to have this technology for themselves.
In the end, they were fended off with an explanation that the development has just started and the magic is quite a ways off from achieving stability and safety.
Well, humans have always dreamed of flying through the sky.
So, despite my being a first-year student, the research for my graduation was decided for me.
That is, to develop a magic tool for flying in the sky.
Hey, would it be fine to not make it like an airplane, hm?
Well, let’s develop a couple of different types.
And so, I ended up taking lessons on creating magic tools… But wait, if I make one, won’t I be the only one who’s able to use it anyway?
Though our family members will certainly be able to.
Rather, it’s definitely impossible to make it without help from others…
So, after finishing submitting the written apologies, I got called up by Father.
Spare me more lecturing, please…
“Miranda, I feel that the long-standing dream of our Mirandiehl family will soon be achieved.”
“Whut?”
“Did you not fly in the sky?”
“Yes, I did. Was this a dream of our family?”
“That’s right, Grande was involved in this research in the MKO while serving there as a knight. I am the same; I worked on it in the spare moments of my prime minister’s work… The Karpf Tetras and the Arkrays, with their own specialties in their attributes they try to put to use, served the country splendidly, but we, the Mirandiehls, didn’t have any characteristics we could be proud of.”
“And now we have it with my flying magic? If you use our Wind magic correctly, you can even control the weather with it, though.”
“Wait a minute, what do you mean by that? I haven’t heard anything about it.”
Whaaa? So our family’s magic wasn’t useful for the kingdom?
“We, the Mirandiehls, have achieved notoriety for our Wind magic long-distance offense. I think you remember that we are a branch family started by the younger brother of His Majesty the first king, yes?”
“Yes, I learned about that in history lessons.”
“In other words, we have our current position thanks to our military prowess.”
“Should I take this as us being a faction of warriors or muscle-brains, huh?”
“Muscle-brains?”
“Ah, please do not pay it any mind.”
Yes, as a girl, I haven’t been involved in martial arts, but our family is quite a bunch of meatheads.
Still, since we also have a lot of mana capacity, we don’t really rely only on “muscle strength.”
However, this is certainly my first time hearing of this dearest wish we hold as a family.
“When I heard about how my daughter was flying in the sky above the capital, I, as one would expect, thought it a distasteful joke at the time.”
“I am very sorry for what I did then.”
“Don’t fret. Miranda, can you show me that here right now?”
“Can I really do it in this place? And wait, is it okay for me to fly now, even?”
“I will get permission from His Highness later, so I’ll ask you then again.”
“I understand.”
Uweeeh, does it mean that at my flying show there will be the top executives of the whole country present?
Man, I still can’t wrap my head around that dearest wish thingie… If I knew about it, I should have made an airplane first and not tried to fly myself…
It seems that due to my being a girl, nobody expected anything from me, and after I was chosen as a fiancee for Teal, as per the Mirandiehl family’s rules, there’s no point in going farther, so I wasn’t told about it at all.
Wait, what my family even tried to do with their secret research, anyway?
What’s more, what are you doing there so that your own daughter won’t ever know about it, eh, boyos…
Well, as I was able to achieve that wish without meaning to, I guess I’ll cooperate with you now, father.
------------------ 
Chapter 114 – The cultural festival and other things in schoolHowever close this school resembles a university, in spite of that, or even because it’s still a school… it has a cultural festival.
For the students from arts clubs, it’s a place where they can show off themselves once a year, and every class does its own piece for it.
From the gates to the school building itself, there are stalls, and all nobles and residents living in the area are visiting this festival.
Moreover, the timing of this cultural festival is right at the start of the social season.
It’s a time when nobles gather at the capital, and the students that come from far away can meet their families here, as the only other time they can do it is during summer vacation.
All in all, this is one of the places for social gatherings.
Since a lot of commoners attend this school, it’s also a place for job hunting, as they try to appeal their worth to the families of noble students they grew close with while in the school.
“That’s why first-year A class, through exhibiting the dollhouses, will be adding to the history of our glorious nobles’ school; as such, we now will be planning on making the construction plans for them.”
Everyone clapped excitedly.
This was all I said, and all the while my face was twitching.
Why did it end up like this…
When talking about dollhouses, you immediately think of them as a local specialty of the Mirandiehl territory, a luxury item that became a product that not only nobles but even commoners love dearly, and when I mentioned “I can do one by myself,” the class decided to make it our exhibit.
Heeey, are you alright not choosing something normal, like a maid cafe or food stand?
Well, as it’s related to my research, I guess it’s okay.
In this school, due to the history of adding more and more buildings aside from the school building itself, the lines of people gathered here, especially in the clubrooms and training range, are enormous.
It makes you think, “Hey, can’t you do something with this, no?”
Class A has people learning architecture and people who strive to be doctors, so here’s the thought about making access here barrier-free for everyone.
As soon as the story was coming together well, when I said what I said, everything just ended up going in that direction. I am now presenting my research papers.
But wait, not only the girls, but even some of the boys from our class seem to have become rather hooked on dollhouses, though what we are doing has changed a little on the way and has become closer to making dioramas.
According to them, they can help in recreating various scenes from a tale or a story.
Thanks to that, the dollhouses themselves and their scale have changed somewhat.
It’s now 1/35, to be exact.
Isn’t this like a plastic model diorama? It looks very fun, not gonna lie… Let me in there too, please.
With that said, we decided on our piece for the festival, and after making preparations, I ended up with this situation of placing orders at the dollhouse factory in the Mirandiehl territory.
I’m sorry for making you work more, workers of the factory.
But there’s no problem as they will be paid for that, so while I’m at it, why don’t I use the data gathered this time and make a school series of dollhouses, all to make nobles reminisce about their youth that passed fleetingly all those years ago for them? Please start making them immediately; I’m sure this will sell.
Sorry for skipping time forward, but the cultural festival ended without any problems.
We got quite rave reviews.
And who gave them to us if not the aristocrats that visited?
So many pre-orders, fufufufufu.
Thanks to us faithfully recreating the school where they had so many fond memories.
Noble wives, especially, had placed a staggering number of orders.
I made quite a killing there compared to some half-assed stands, yeah! After all, one dollhouse costs a lot of money.
The profits were donated to the school by yours truly.
I can’t take them all for myself… That’s what the cultural festival is for… They extort money from nobles by having them donate it to the school.
The year is ending soon, too… It’s good that there weren’t any incidents.
------------------ 
Chapter 115 – The graduation ceremony for Teal and others“The graduation ceremony is now starting.”
Sup! Miranda greets you.
Today the graduation ceremony is held.
It’s being done right at the end of the social season.
And, as this is the day of now-ex-students like Teal and Lady Tolastina, a lot of distinguished persons, like His Majesty the King and others, are in attendance here.
By the way… I did say this here is like a university, yeah? To tell you the truth, not everyone graduates here after three years of study.
There are heaps and scores of those who repeat a year here.
Also, it’s possible to graduate without that in the C class, but it’s considered very dishonorable, so nobles usually try to graduate while being in the B class or higher.
Having decided where they will be working in the future, there are a lot of commoners who aren’t in great need of specialized knowledge graduating from the C class.
Of course they can graduate from A class and take exams for applying to various ministries, so this is the variety of which this school is so proud.
Still, there’s quite a lot of people of Teal’s age…
The hall for the ceremony is chock-full…
Teal is responsible for giving a speech as a representative.
When it ends, there will be a commemoration party.
I, as a currently attending school student, will be participating and am already wearing a dress… Yes, Teal gifted me it; how did you know?
We will be going together, with me being escorted by him.
This is usually when the breaking off of an engagement scene in this kind of game happens.
It’s okay; there’s no need to worry.
Also, the one I was concerned about, Lady Tolastina, who occasionally comes to our home to drown in the mountain of plushies, had her mental state stabilized by doing that, so I left her alone after that.
It’s just that, probably thanks to that, she and Lord Rabble’s relationship improved considerably, and even then, she said to me that she would be coing from time to time to do what she usually does.
Hey, do you remember, Lady Tolastina, that you’re more or less from the opposing faction? Right? Not like I care all that much, but I do wonder: just how long does she plan on coming to that detached house of mine to indulge in her hobbies?
Well, it’s better to be united as a country than to oppose each other. It’s not like I’m in any position to complain.
“Finally, the ceremony ended.”
“Good work out there, Teal.”
“Yeah, and at the party later I will be officially declared as a Crown Prince, and you, Miranda, as my fiancee, will be attending an explanatory meeting detailing your future position as a Crown Princess, and after all that we will be dancing.”
“Is it OK for me to dance?”
“I got permission from Father and Duke Mirandiehl.”
“Ya know. It’s only in things like this that you are quite fast on the uptake…”
“Miranda, watch your tone.”
“Wait five seconds; I will fix my good girl mask.”
Is it me, or does it really feel like recently Teal has become more honest with his desires? Well, it loads better than carrying unreleased stress inside himself, but how to put it? He sometimes behaves like a middle-school boy.
“So, let us go, prince?”
“I am amazed every time you don this mask of a proper lady from a ducal house.”
“Well, of course. I have a switch on the back of my neck I use in these situations, after all.”
“You joking, right?
“Of course I am.”
When we enter, we’ll need to greet His Majesty.
The queen said to me that she was relieved to see us so close together.
Yep, yep, we do often flirt with each other, yah? Well, it’s a little doubtful when our relationship is called that of great love, but eh, if they both approve of us and don’t have any problem with that, I’m okay with it too.
After everyone here gathered and the king had his say, there should be a first dance, and, well, it’s generally the time when you dance with your betrothed there.
And, for Teal, that would be me, but as a twelve-year-old who’s not a proper adult yet, it’s “not allowed for you to be present here,” but eh, it was just waved away like a nuisance it is.
So be it; I will dance with you, Teal.
Taking each other’s hand, we started twirling around.
This wasn’t an impassioned dance where you stuck close to each other.
“You’re surprisingly good at this, Miranda.”
“It’s hard to adjust for the height difference, so it’s hella tiring.”
“What. Did. I. Say. Earlier?”
“It is true that I am having troubles, so please go easier on me.”
“Really… Still, to be able to correct for the difference and dance so easily… “
Right now, my height is barely scratching the 150-cm mark. Teal, on the other hand, is close to 175 cm, and here you have it, the 25 cm difference.
He’s a head taller than me, and looking straight at him, I can only see his chest.
And what’s worse, with that stature, he’s also slim and has quite a good physique.
Moreover, look at his waist. It’s so tight compared to mine.
I am not jealous of him or anything!
And so, the graduation party came to an end without any troubles.
Our dance with Teal was rated rather highly by those present.
They said how it’s great for Miranda to have such a gentle partner who tried to match her pace, but hey, it was me who desperately tried to match his pace, you bastards!
That Teal, making me barely hold myself from snapping, gah.
I won’t forgive you. You hear me?
------------------ 
Chapter 116 – A new semester and my goals for this yearErr, having cleared the first year with top place, and so, later, after I finish writing my graduation thesis, I’ll have enough qualifications to graduate.
You probably don’t understand what I’m talking about. Teal just the other day made an unreasonable request: “Okay, now graduate this year.”
As we are still yet to marry, I’m not “crown princess” for now, but theoretically, I had a weird title of “provisional crown princess” attached to me and was told to hurry and graduate so I could marry into the royal family.
The wedding itself will be when I turn fifteen, so why can’t I be allowed to graduate normally?
So as it stands, my graduation thesis will be called “The development of magic to fly on your own and finding a method to make it all-purpose.”
Thanks to my flying in the sky, it was understood that it’s possible to create flight magic usable by one person, though it was also made clear that unless someone has the same large amount of mana and magic control that I have, it’s “impossible.”
That’s because my father, who was said to be unrivaled in his Wind magic, wasn’t able to fly at all, and Brother Grande was able to lightly float and nothing more.
And so, I was tasked with creating the magic tool for unassisted solo flight.
A baron’s daughter, Chris McCain, was officially contracted by our teacher to help me, and we were told that we together would be responsible for doing this research for our graduation.
The plan is at first to create a Wind magic specialized tool and, going off of that, find a way to increase its versatility.
It’s because the magic I used was created by combining Wind and Fire attribute magics, and since the method by which it works is based on a jet engine, those who can’t imagine how it works cannot use this magic.
So, I think that we will first establish the Wind magic parts, and then the Fire magic parts will be simplified, and then the magic will be complete.
For one person to be able to fly, I don’t think there’s much need for highly heated air in this jet engine lookalike.
With the method I used, the temperature inside was 500 degrees, and the exhaust temperature was 40 degrees Celcius.
Thinking about it now, I was too full of myself to fly in a skirt. It could have been burned off if I had made an error.
Well, bearing that experience in mind, for more stable and safe output adjustment, first I, who was able to control that, would need to create a magic tool that only I can use, then formularize the magic I use, and finally make it attributeless.
The other thing, the development of the all-purpose flying method, was because I took upon myself without thinking the request of the Air Force to devise a method to make a glider I created to fly without using dragons.
Why? Because in the end, the maintenance and management costs of the dragons, the need for breeding, and their being monsters make it quite difficult to overcome problems with their own risks. The scope of where dragons can be used is limited mostly to being weapons, so with AF needing a stable footing for the future, they want an “aircraft” that will be able to fly without questions asked.
Thinking about it, I, who was thrilled after knowing that by using dragons you can fly here, didn’t consider all those problems that must be present.
I forgot the adage, “The best weapon is that which can provide 100% of its capabilities that are needed at the time when it is used.”
If military otaku had heard about what I did, they’d surely have been shocked.
Listen! A weapon that has the best defense and the greatest attack power isn’t what a good weapon is.
In that sense, the dragons that can use their breath are small in number; if they aren’t willing, you won’t be able to fly; it’s not guaranteed that they will be usable when needed; you can’t count on a stable supply of them (as they are living beings); and you can’t count on them for shit to be your main force.
In the end, they are only usable for reconnaissance for now.
Well, it in itself is quite an important role.
As there are no wars between countries nowadays, the dragons help the Navy with reconnaissance missions and nothing more.
And, well, they are used during monster subjugations against dragons.
Dragon vs. Dragon, PvP of the year!
Their advantages are air mobility and hovering ability, which are impossible for airplanes.
Can you imagine what will happen to an airplane if it stops immediately after flying at top speed, eh?
Of course, I don’t plan on suddenly bringing the tilt-rotor helicopter to the world, though I feel that a jet plane is a possibility.
Hmm. If I were to fuck it up, I could see how the skies are full of jet planes in this world that have yet to make its first steam locomotive run…
All of what was said before is what I’m going to focus on this year.
When Teal asked me, “Are you okay with being busy doing your research?” I told him that it’s for my graduation, though I won’t say no to his visits.
And hey, even if this is what I’ll be doing for my graduation, there’s quite a lot of confidential matters we are dealing with here, so it’s impossible to do this in the school itself…
Our home’s garden is my testing ground.
I’m sorry, people in the hospital, for having you listen to the sounds of explosions. I’ll think up a countermeasure soon, so forgive me for now.
And Father, you are quite proficient in the use of sound-blocking magic, I hear, so how about you cover the testing grounds with it? I beg of you.
------------------ 
Chapter 117 – Lady Tolastina’s weddingSup. Today I’m attending a wedding.
The one who is being married is the daughter of a Duke of Arkray, Lady Tolastina.
As one of the three ducal families of the Karpf Theria Kingdom, Teal will need to attend it as a representative of the royal family.
Consequently, I will be present there too.
It’s half an official duty and half attending a friend’s wedding after being invited there.
The place to hold it is a cathedral in the capital.
The ceremony consists of saying the words of vow and being blessed by the Goddess of Love. That’s it.
“It looks good on you, Lady Tolastina.”
“I am very grateful for your words, Lady Miranda.”
At present, we two plus Lady Cascia are celebrating in the bride’s waiting room.
Teal with boys went to where Rabble is.
“Still, who could have thought that we Arkrays would become so close with Mirandiehls and Karpf Tetras?”
“What’s with that so suddenly, Father?”
“Well, if it were 10 years ago, I wouldn’t be able to imagine every faction gathering like this and being amicable with others, much less doing this wedding…”
Duke Arkray fell into a deeply emotional state.
Eh, that’s true. Some years ago, the nobles’ assembly was filled with distrust for each other, and it was hard to imagine people from different factions talking so freely and without holding back…
It could be said that I was the one who broke the walls between factions, right?
“There are advantages and disadvantages to everything, so it’s par for the course that factions form, but aren’t we, the nobles of the kindgom, all wishing for it to be prosperous? Our current times can be called the age of turmoil, thanks to the rapid development of technology. If we don’t cooperate with each other when we can, we will be biting the dust of other countries, so I think that the communication between us all is indispensable, don’t you think?”
“Quite right! But to think that the one to make us open our eyes was a thirteen-year-old Miss Mirandiehl… Hahaha!”
Hmmm, but I think that Duke Arkray himself has mellowed out quite a bit.
I still remember how dreadfully he looked at me when I visited Lady Tolastina for the first time in their home. And there I thought that nobles should be prudent with their feelings.
That twitching face he showed me later was the best!
“Everyone, it’s time.”
A maid in the Arkray family’s employ has called out to us.
Now, I need to return to where the other attendees are.
By the way, as it should be obvious (?), at this wedding, Rabble will be taking Lady Tolastina’s family name.
She’s the eldest daughter, after all. The family needs an heir.
At school, she already studies how to manage a territory.
Despite this, she came to me crying for help, as she’s bad at math. My friend was so cute then.
“Hey, Teal? When it will be our turn, the wedding will be more gorgeous than this, right?”
“Yes.”
“Isn’t it overly flashy?”
“Yep, I’m already getting cold feet.”
“Right.”
“But well, that’s my duty.”
“Innit?”
Hah, look at us having such absolutely stupid and shocking talk in this place.
I do want a wedding ceremony done, but as far as I saw it with Arkrays already, just imagining how the scale of ours will be even greater, I can only nervously gulp.
Still, this is definitely something that you will remember all your life.
I can predict the people making the big deal of it all, what with me becoming a member of the royal family and all that.
I would need to wave my hand to citizens while riding in an open carriage…
Hah… What torture.
So, the wedding proceeded solemnly, the celebratory words for them both were all said, and after everyone had eaten, it was time to return home.
I worried about how Lord Rabble and Lady Tolastina would deal with this all, but there were no major problems afterwards.
Though I sometimes meet with Lady Tolastina, who occasionally comes to bury herself in plushies and complain about Rabble… It seems that even after marriage, she will continue to do this.
But I have to commend the Arkrays for throwing a grand wedding celebration party at their home.
There were not only nobles from the Moulinie Kingdom, but even those from the Charlesdegau Kingdom, which is located quite far away from us.
At our future wedding, the royals from surrounding countries will be in attendance, for sure, and it makes me on edge even more… I’d need to watch for any cracks that might appear in the mask I will be wearing.
------------------ 
Chapter 118 – It’s finally here! Maternity welfare clinic and learned society for gynecologistsDespite the social season not being in session, today there’s a presentation at the castle.
The one in charge of it is my mother.
What is announced here is that the ARLMCW will have its name changed to maternity welfare clinic and the establishment of the learned society for gynecologists.
After giving the report to His Majesty, together with the making of that society, the country’s certifications were decided upon for working in the departments of internal medicine and surgery.
You see, the doctors often take a day off every week, okay? The reason is that they go to that society to learn. My point is that what I said earlier is the reason for this.
Mrs. Viola Divella was also invited here today.
That’s because she became the first obstetrician-gynecologist.
Until now, the royal women were barely able to be examined by female doctors, but the concept of gynecology didn’t exist before, so now it will be adopted here and made more known little by little in the future.
The official certification will be done next month.
Her Majesty the Queen gave her speech, and Lady Viola was handed the appointment papers.
“From now on, I hope you will be doing good work and continue to dedicate yourself to the health care of women.”
“I humbly accept your words.”
I’m attending today as a simple guest and not as someone from the royal family’s side.
The dress for Miss Viola was prepared by me, and she managed to look like a perfect noble lady.
Even if she was very serious and stiff.
With the ceremony over, I returned to the maternity welfare clinic’s building.
“Thank you for your hard work, Miss Viola. Now you are officially a gynecologist.”
“I am thankful for your words. This is all thanks to you. Lady Miranda.”
“That’s right. Now I hope it will serve as a stepping stone for women to move up in the world.”
“Yes, absolutely. It will be good if our work helps with the health problems female workers deal with.”
I concur. With the recent progress brought about by the Industrial Revolution, the number of women working at factories has increased, and with that, the incidence of on-the-job accidents involving women has grown in proportion.
Accidents aside, understanding of problems stemming from women’s physiques among men hasn’t progressed much yet, so there are almost no day-offs for dealing with those problems.
It’s usual for them to receive a deduction from their salary for every day off they take.
As this is inconvenient, I think that there’s a need to disseminate the necessary knowledge far and wide.
With the government’s approval now, the school’s medical sciences course has the study of gynecology and obstetrics added, and when it becomes known throughout the country, that unfair women’s “physiological phenomenon” prejudiced view will finally become a thing of the past.
Nowadays, in noble women’s circles, the clinic that’s located on the Mirandiehl lot has become common knowledge, and a lot of people visit there every day.
The noble ladies who were holding off on having children are a given, and with the concepts of menopausal disorders in old women, the clearing of prejudices about what a balanced diet is due to them being nobles, and abnormalities of not exercising physically now known, the understanding of the complexity surrounding female health coming to a head, the research continues even now.
I myself do know about isoflavones in soybeans, and I again gave a throwaway line of “I think it’s good to eat dishes containing soybeans.”
And it seems that it actually worked.
The researchers, without my knowing it, carried out an experiment with dividing female workers into two groups and having Group A eat usual food, while Group B was recommended to eat food containing soybeans.
Is this country alright with conducting human experiments that nonchalantly?
Still, it’s not like they can test it on mice, and it’s better to test it on humans than risk experimenting on animals without any concern for them… There’s quite a high possibility of death there, so there’s no way they will be allowed to do it.
I’d need to consult with Teal about all this.
Okay, since the government officially approved gynecology and its work has started in earnest, the work on improving the clinic has begun.
Finally, the distinction in the entrances for commoners and nobles went away, thankfully.
The number of nurses also grew considerably.
After the necessity of having them acknowledged, with Miss Rin taking the lead, the construction plans for the school for nurses are now making progress.
Doctors need staff to support them after all.
It all makes me think that the Karpf Theria Kingdom has become a leading force in medical care.
------------------ 
Chapter 119 – The research on flight magic“The improvement of the flight propulsion system Lady Miranda developed is finished.”
We are now at the Mirandiehl test site.
Here we are testing the flight unit developed by me and Chris.
“How much is the output?”
“One can achieve a pull of 10 kg.”
“Since Chris was able to start it up, if we use a couple more, we can probably make people fly.”
“I would like to increase the size, but this is the limit…”
If possible, my ultimate goal would be the creation of an airplane, but the size of the engine cannot be increased more.
The regular ones don’t use any magic; that’s why they are big, I think, and if someone were to try and build an engine with that output alone, they would just be blown away by that power, so I guess reproducing it is no-go…
For now, an individual flight suit (temp) was completed, and I had Brother Grande come to see us.
“If it’s for my sister, I’ll accept any and all requests.”
“Then, Brother. Please equip this.”
Matching his weight, I gave him two engines for each hand and had him carry on his back the third.
“Now, if you spread your arms and make mana flow, it should start up.”
“I see. Let me try.”
The explosive noise started to rev up steadily.
I can’t do anything with this whistling wind sound when the output increases…
I plugged my ears with the prepared earplugs.
Since Brother had to have seen me fly, by emulating it, he should handle it.
When I gestured to him, slowly bringing my arms together, he, having understood it, did the same.
Little by little, he started to float up.
It seems that it’s a bit hard to keep balance, but it should be okay.
As Brother is a physically fit knight, he is able to support himself with only his muscles and not rely only on his mana reserves, I think.
He had a big smile while sowly flying around the test site in circles.
Is being able to fly that fun… Unless you have a trained body and apply a strengthening magic to yourself, this flight magic is unusable, but if it needs only this, then anyone can eventually become able to fly, no?
“Miranda, can you still fly with this even in full equipment?”
Brother, having returned and ceased the noise when his mana was exhausted, asked me this.
“At present, the maximum weight it can pull should be 90 kg… So for you, an additional 15 kg would be the limit, I guess?”
His swelling muscles weigh quite a lot, after all.
“I see… The complete set of Magic Knight’s equipment is more than 30 kg, so it’s impossible, huh?”
“Want to use more engines? Two on the back and one more for each arm, what do you think?”
“I’d like to. If possible, I want the Order to know about it.”
Brother answered me all the while smiling brilliantly.
Is it okay? Will it be of any use with its loud noise that can scare anyone, even monsters?
Well, if a war were to break out, that noise would tell anyone about the arrival of our country’s knights.
“Please let me improve it a little more. I think that for now, it lacks stability.”
“Got it. Sorry for burdening you even more, but can I ask you to make 5 sets for knights to use while you make adjustments?”
“Give me money to do this, then.”
“Okay, you shrewd girl.”
Doing it normally, 3 sets should have been enough, but with the increase in the number of engines, I will be taking the money, no questions.
He probably wants them for his team.
I guess the practical use as a team will help them verify the legibility of the technology.
“As you heard, Chris. Please make five sets with the increased propulsion.”
“Understood… Why so suddenly, if I may ask? Why so many?”
“We will begiving them to the Magic Knight troop. I am sure the army will ask for similar numbers…”
“It is quite busy work for mere graduation research.”
“We are both going to have a hard time.”
You can only let out a sigh here.
Still, it can’t be helped that the expectations we have from others are very high.
As we have even prepared and placed a sound-blocking magic tool around the site, we can’t really complain now.
If they end up being used anyway, why not use the feedback we will have gotten to improve further? Let’s think positively.
------------------ 
Chapter 120 – The glider is ready now, so let’s slap an engine on it!Today we have imposed on the Air Force.
As a result of me using my spotty knowledge and my offhanded comment, “Make the wings like this; the wing area and the speed should become doubled,” both the magic tool craftsman and the researcher from the AF worked together and made a prototype, and I was invited to see it.
“This is the completed prototype glider.”
What stood before me was a wooden, cloth-covered glider.
They still weren’t able to let go of the bird-like design, but the wings’ curvature looks solid, and after testing it with a dragon pulling it, the thing could fly, so it’s good.
Here’s hoping that it will be polished further in the future.
So, why was I called? They wanted to place the thrust generation system we developed on it, seemingly wanting to test if it was possible to make it fly on its own.
You know, the thing can pull only 10 kg. Will it be enough?
Well, if you can ensure lift, even that propulsion would be enough for it to fly, I think…
Also, I won’t be riding it; the AF officer will have the privilege of being a test subject.
How lucky, since I don’t know how to operate it.
“This is the TGS. Depending on where you place it on the fuselage, the balance could very well break, and you won’t be able to fly, you know?”
“Don’t worry, when we heard about how it works, there was a deliberation as to where to place it, and now we have already prepared the mountings for it.”
Well, even if it were to fail, I’m not responsible, okay?
Chris gave the officer the engine tubes.
They immediately started installing them.
“Lady Miranda, do you think it will go well?”
“I bet 1 silver on them crashing.”
“Please lower the rate.”
I absolutely think they will crash.
It is surely impossible to do it properly after installing the things for the first time.
However great the calculations made, airplanes are still very much an unknown technology.
I think it could be good to attach engines to an airship… Ah, but is it possible?
“Chris, when we return, there’s a thing I want to do.”
“Did you come up with something?”
“I am thinking about making a way to fly farther than using this glider.”
“This sounds exciting.”
That’s right, there was an airship there.
Eh? But can I generate helium?
It’s quite difficult to use hydrogen and not have it burn up.
By the way, the test ended in a spectacular failure.
It pitched forward and fell.
I thought then that it, after flowing up, would definitely fall by either leaning forward or backward.
After the test, the pilot guy was alright.
For now, we were asked to lend the engines for the improvement work on the test unit, so they were left in their care.
I wouldn’t mind giving them more if they wouldn’t be able to generate enough thrust.
But I gotta focus on the development of an airship.
Should I start by attaching an engine to a blimp?
Let’s think it over a little.
After all, I can’t be sure if I can get helium, and as such, trying to make it bigger can be dangerous.
In that case, implementing the hot-air balloon would probably be faster.
This technology was already put into practical use… I blame my obsession with airplanes on dragons.
Let’s just use the airship and personal flight units as my graduation thesis and get the school over and done with.
I need to talk with Chris about this.
------------------ 
Chapter 121 – The airship is complete, and the qualifications for graduation“Lady Miranda, it’s flying!”
“Wow, I see the whole world from here!”
“Ah, Lady Miranda, I see my mansion!”
Everyone is certainly excited.
I am Miranda.
The airship project I thought up half a year ago progressed smoothly, and the AF were able to use the hot-air balloon with the applied motive power.
And, after that, the development of the airship continued further; unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get my hands on helium, so we ended up using hydrogen…
The wooden cloth-covered frame filled with hydrogen produced by electrolyzing water was able to achieve buoyancy. Two powered-down engines were strapped to the carrier gondola, which also had a rudder attached to it.
Well, were I to board it, I could control it with magic in the worst case, but basically, only the engines are used for propulsion.
And like that, the completed prototype airship ended up quite easy to steer, and since everyone is able to easily operate it, we turned it into a facility on the Mirandiehls’ land as one of the tourist attractions where people can fly in the sky.
Still, we can’t mass produce it yet.
Thanks to the help of the alchemist, Miss Julie, we were able to scrounge together enough for one; that’s why we can’t make more for now.
Electricity doesn’t exist here, ya know!
As a result, the maintenance costs are through the roof.
Though the novelty-liking nobles were quite enamored with it. So today I invited Lady Tolastina, Lady Cascia, and Lady Margaret, and after a tea party, we boarded the airship together.
By the way, when I and Chris demonstrated how it flies at the school last week, we got qualified for graduation.
This year will be our last!
Teal was very happy himself.
Due to that, I was able to successfully evade the fate of becoming a student council’s president.
So next year, even if it’s a little early, I am to be officially recognized as a crown princess.
Teal has recently started unnerving me with his fidgeting.
Just since when did you become so honest with your desires? I won’t forgive you. You hear me?
I have already told him to be prepared to be dressed as a woman on our first night, but man, why was only his heart the only thing that became manly…
“Then, we’ll take a round of the capital. Is there any particular place you’d like to see?”
“I will leave it to you, Lady Miranda.”
Lady Tolastina gave me her answer, all the while hugging a rabbit plushie to her chest.
How long have you had this toy with you? Just where did you take out this rabbit, as when we boarded the carriage, it wasn’t with you?
Even after getting married, Lady Tolastina, when I am at home, frequently visits us to play with my plushies by jumping into a pile of them and staying there.
She seems to have started taking over from her father the job of managing the territory, but it’s quite hard, and, with her father turning out to be shit at doing his work, she’s accumulated quite a lot of anxieties.
Lady Tolastina said to me that she almost fainted when she saw the ledger.
Well, if my place can help her unwind, who am I to complain?
As she’s a close friend, I let her ride for free, but usually we take 2 gold coins for flying in the airship once.
Producing hydrogen is such hard work, I tell you…
Magic can generate lightning, but since it cannot provide a stable flow of direct current, it’s no good.
I was forced to come to terms with the reality that magic can fail you in the most unexpected of places.
It seems that it is being used only for attacking due to that downside.
Thinking about it, the ones who developed the daily magic were very amazing people.
Recently, I have finally mastered all attributes of magic at an intermediate or higher level, so my goal is almost complete.
I feel bad for Riselle, but I cannot just go and graduate as fast as possible.
We are classmates, after all.
After going around the capital once, we returned.
The flight itself is already quite stable, so it’s easy to do.
“Thank you for letting me fly in it.”
“I, too, am thankful for having such a magnificent trip in the sky.”
“It felt like we became birds.”
Lady Cascia gave me her honest impressions.
“I felt like one who was controlled by the skies. It was a great experience.”
It seems like Lady Margaret is still quite twisted even now… Once chuunibyou, forever chuunibyou.
Well, the most important thing is that you enjoyed yourself…
------------------ 
Chapter 122 – The graduation ceremony that came all too soonIt came faster than expected, but today we graduate.
At this year’s cultural festival, we gathered as a class and created an airship that we had developed before.
I and Chris provided engines, and as for other things, our classmates took it upon themselves to make them.
There was someone who had devised a new technology for different ways of steering it, so despite it being a hot-air balloon, it turned out to be a weird one that has quite a bit of maneuverability.
It was not a laughing matter when some of the AF people who saw it gave up on the airplane for now and switched sides.
After that, the thing we got in the end was a hot-air balloon-type airship that you could see in some fantasy RPGs.
A wooden flying “ship” that’s able to transport a whole army troop has finally been created.
It’s an airship equipped with four hot-air balloons and ten propulsion devices we developed, and it achieves buoyancy by magic.
A new type of in-flight steering device we developed in the academy is used on it, and the whole thing feels like a large transport plane.
With a little remodeling, it could be turned into a bomber…
Also, the personal flight suit Brother Grande asked me to make was adopted and put to use by the Magic Knight Order.
Even though the problem of the noise wasn’t solved, it’s now possible to make a fully armored person equipped with a sword and shield or a lance to fly, so that thing, too, ended up using ten devices.
With the improved magic circuits, if the person with the necessary mana capacity requirements of the Knight Order were to use them, they could fly from the capital to any place in the country in under two days at most.
This quite a long time is a result of the balance between the maximum speed and mana usage we found in the end.
Also, as it’s hard to fly as-is due to the loud noise, earplugs are a must.
Still, it’s a big jump from the past when, to deal with an emergency request for dispoding of the suddenly appearing magic-using monsters, it took ten days to arrive at the place of their sighting.
Based on this spectacular achievement, I and Chris successfully graduated this year.
Chris herself is going to become a magic tool craftsman employed by us, the Mirandiehls. That’s thanks to my efforts.
“Miranda! Congratulations on your graduation! When will you come to the palace? Tomorrow? The day after that?”
“You’re so impatient, Teal. I’m still underage. I believe you were told that I would be getting more education for the next year.”
“Geh…”
“The wedding itself will also be held then. So for now, be a good boy and “wait” like a dog.”
“You wound me…”
“Whatever. You really become manly in the weirdest of places.”
“I haven’t trained my body.”
“I can see it by looking. Even now, you can be a great otoko no ko. For that, I commend you.”
When the “graduation ceremony” ended, we headed to the commemoration party, and the one who escorted me was Teal.
This time, too, he sent me a dress to wear—a little age-unappropriate sexy thing.
Even now, the lines of my body, which are slender at best and seedy at worst, without any excess fat, are accentuated on the front by the silk dress, which, while covering my chest, was designed to leave my back quite exposed for everyone to see.
Well, I covered it with my hair, so no biggie.
That’s why, with this dress, I don’t need to wear anything aside from panties.
This garment boasts quite a number of lacings, and the upper half’s shape kinda reminds me of a bunny suit.
It’s light green in color with the beautiful blue embroidery, and a royal family crest is sewn on it.
Having something the color of Teal’s eyes is fine, but putting the crest on it is a little early.
And, since I graduated, I will now be continuing the once-put-on-hold queen’s education lessons from now on.
Again, I’m gonna commute to the castle… Teal will definitely catch me there and force me to have tea with him…
“I’m having quite the fun dressing up Miranda. You are so cute and pretty.”
“Can you stop trying to honestly compliment me and embarrass me at the same time? You give off vibes of “you my dress-up darling,” you know?”
“Well, it’s true, though…”
“Teal… You aren’t hiding from me something very naughty, are you?”
“Be prepared for after our marriage. I am not going to be the one to put up with praise.”
“!!! So that’s why I recently saw you sneaking around with Miss Rui!”
“Fufufu. There’s a new underwear brand that is quite popular nowadays.”
“I had a feeling that a lot of new brands appeared, but to think that it was something like this…”
It’s true that the other day, I got a catalog from Miss Rui with her saying that there were new brands in there, and when I looked, I saw a lot of cute and modern-looking underwear drawn in there.
I bought it without thinking, and it was my blunder that I won’t ever forget, as the thing I got was suggested by Teal.
“I mean, there are still corsets in use in this world, and not enough cute underwear, after all.”
“Did you want to wear them yourself?”
“No? I wanted you to wear it, Miranda.”
“Figures…”
What the hell are we talking about in the waiting room before the graduation party…
Well, it’s par for the course for us, in a sense.
The party went on and ended without any particular troubles.
I spinned and twirled in a dance with Teal quite a lot.
My father and both my brothers, too, asked me for a dance.
I am sure it was very hard for them to dance with a short girl like me. I am barely 155 cm tall.
Compared to the noble girls of my generation, I’m decidedly small.
I do eat properly, though… I really look like a loli.
Will I grow a little more in the future, I wonder?
------------------ 
Chapter 123 – Moving and the resumed queen’s educationIt’s some time after my graduation, and I turned fourteen.
Today I am moving.
Just as when the ceremony ended and the social season went into a lull, I have already done preparations for the move, and during the birthday party next month, I will stay there in the castle to live.
I was forced to do this by Teal.
I thought that I could spend one more year at my family home, but there is no point in agonizing over it now.
The hobby room in the detached house was decided to be left as is.
It turned out that while I was at school studying, my mother and her friends frequently used it, and they took a liking to the comfort it brought.
When I saw Mother, who surrounded herself with plushies, I almost toppled over from dizziness and shock.
That place turned into a very important haven where you can see the often unthinkable behavior of the noble ladies who usually hold themselves together at tea and evening parties.
I didn’t think Mother would end up doing the same thing as Lady Tolastina… Also, other noble wives participated in playing with dolls… It’s good that they were able to not lose their inner child.
Maybe it was thanks to that that a second plushie boom happened, and in the end, even some crazy products like “life-sized nuis” have begun to appear.
Those giant nuis and plushies are often securely put into wooden boxes, then sent as-is to noble mansions to be delivered at madam’s or their daughter’s room, where they are opened.
It seems there are a lot of those who sleep hugging the toys in their arms.
They are especially popular with elderly women.
I bet it’s those who don’t want to sleep with their husbands…
But, on the contrary, small “nuis” are popular with younger kids.
The ones that are as big as a palm of a hand, which you can put in a handbag.
Like otakus from my past life, people keep these toys to help calm their psyches.
It seems that having a plush of a poplar character you like brings peace to your heart when you return from an evening party.
Also, there’s those who, like me, love to enjoy making L to their Bs, and I think it’s a good thing indeed.
“Thank you for coming, Miranda. Sorry for my son’s behavior.”
“I do not mind it, Your Majesty. Thank you for accepting me even if I am not yet an adult.”
At the stopping place for carriages at the back of the castle, Queen herself went to meet me when I arrived.
I will be living in a royal villa where she herself resides together with Her Majesty, and since my luggage has already been moved there, I have finally finished with my move here.
It should be noted that in this villa, no men are allowed, and it’s more like an inner palace from the Edo period.
That said, the only one who lives there now is the queen herself, as a legal wife of the king.
I was brought by her inside, where I was shown to the room where I will be living.
“You know that I and your mother, Miran, are close friends, right? Since her daughter is to become my family, I became so enthusiastic when I heard it.”
“So Your Majesty and Mother are best friends, I presume?”
“That’s right, little Miranda looks like Miran when she was young, and you are very cute.”
When not in public places, Lady Exschelxior speaks frankly and overall is a very open-hearted person.
There’s quite a difference in the workings of our mask-enabling switches.
Not like I’m one to talk.
“Now I can invite you to a tea without any trouble.”
“Thank you very much, Your Majesty. I hope for and look forward to your continued guidance and taking care of me.”
I did a quick curtsey.
She vigorously nodded at that. It seems that I pass.
From now on, I will be getting the queen’s education lessons directly from the queen herself.
I need to build a good rapport with my future mother-in-law.
The room that I was shown into felt almost like the room I lived in in the home of my family.
Actually, when moving, I left all my plushies and dolls there, so this room is just a high-class one, yet simple and modest.
I also sold all the dresses and jewelry aside from those I liked.
My desire was to lead a minimalist lifestyle.
Of course, it’s like this from the perspective of royalty, so it’s not like I moved here with nothing but clothes on my back.
Also, my personal maid, Lisa, was promoted to palace’s maid.
In addition, she married rather quickly.
It was done without my notice. Eh, it’s okay. She worked for me for so long, and I’m happy for her to find her own happiness.
From tomorrow on, my life in the castle will begin.
------------------ 
Chapter 124 – I turned 15 in a blink of an eyeIt came rather quickly.
In the meantime, there were no particular things to note.
It is Miranda.
Should I mention that my queen’s education also finally came to an end?
I got to know about state secrets, how to do crisis management, and how to control the army in the king’s absence. In the diplomacy lessons, I learned about recent changes in the politics of the neighboring countries, and of course, I now know a lot about the dark side of the royal family.
Yes, there’s no escape for me now. I don’t even want to.
Also, I attended a lot of official businesses sticking with the Queen.
As we worked most of the time outside and not with documents, we ended up going to and fro throughout the whole country.
There were various things we did: visit the orphanages in the capital, observe the training of the knights, conduct on-site inspections of the places recovering from the disasters that befell them, and go to a lot of parties held after diplomatic negotiations.
This one year, Teal spent in a half-dead daze.
Thanks to me living happily with Lady Exschelxior… err, Lady Xior together all this time, I found myself in a peculiar situation where I barely met with him during all this time.
You know, maybe because Lady Xior wasn’t blessed with a second child, she constantly doted on me.
During lessons, she was a picture-perfect teacher; during alone time, she let herself be free.
I got patted to death.
Heh, I didn’t expect to sit in her lap at this age.
The queen was quite tall. Like around 180 cm in height… She’s slender like me, but such a beanpole… 30 cm difference between us.
Moreover, the King is 185 cm tall. So big.
Teal seems to have stopped growing, and now it is around 175 cm.
As for me? Still 156 cm, why? Compared to girls of my age, I am not that tall, won’t ever get fat, and it seems that I end up becoming a legal loli at this point, but is that okay?
Living day to day like this, my fifteenth birthday approached.
This year we will be holding the wedding ceremony, and I have almost become an adult, but what about that?
Recently, I stopped doing research and trying to fly in the sky and threw all my work on others like usual, so during my free time when I’m not going to lessons or doing business, I again started making plushies.
Handmade ones, by yours truly!
After Mother and co. stole my detached building, I conferred with Teal and Lady Xior, and as a result, I had a cabin built in the garden of the royal villa.
As it was made with concrete, the construction didn’t take a lot of time, which is good, and so a one-story lounge was complete.
It’s a place where you can hold tea parties and even small-scale evening parties with alcohol.
Though it didn’t escape the fate of being a fancy-shmancy place.
It seems that the Queen also took an interest in our detached house and wanted a similar one for herself.
That’s how we ended up with a lounge filled to the brim with full-on girlish hobbies and things for her womanly heart to enjoy that brought even me to my knees in scope.
As such, the place has become a worthy opponent to ours when it comes to stuffed toys, since the Queen bought every one she took a fancy to.
Their becoming cheaper didn’t help, either.
Due to the demand for absorbent cotton, the import of cotton rose, which brought us to domestically cultivate it, and as a result, prices for “the most expensive cotton used in making plush toys” have decreased a lot.
Now, even commoners can afford to buy one, and the reusable after washing napkins have also become widely available.
When doing inspections at factories, we forced the distribution of the cloth napkins to female workers, so commoners became aware of their availability.
Of course, they can’t do it like nobles, using them once and throwing them away. But it’s still better than not using them at all.
With the help of Lady Xior, the laws regarding the treatment of women blue collars were drafted, which in turn institutionalized the holiday system for dealing with women-specific problems that occur.
Probably due to that, the Karpf Theria Kingdom has become the most friendly place for women on the continent, and a lot of people have started to immigrate here.
That’s the problem in and of itself.
Most of the new citizens came here from the Empire.
It’s fine, I guess, since they officially left the country, but it could become a bothersome situation if the other party claims that we are stealing their people.
If so, the only thing we could say to them is to fix their damn laws that don’t work.
Doing this and that, my life as a fourteen-year-old passed in a flash.
Also, the AF had adopted the airship in service, and as for the dragons, the forced breeding was stopped, and instead, more thought was put in the direction of placing value on the keeping of strong bloodlines.
The number of dragons able to use breath was increased, and those that couldn’t were sent to be put on sale on the market.
So you can even buy a dragon, huh?
In addition, our Mirandiehl family has become fixated wholly on the development of airplanes.
These days, in the territory, you can see and hear lound noises and spewing fire jet engines every day. Using my magic as a base, Brother Tosted took initiative in finding ways to make them bigger.
The goal is to make an express airplane with a speed similar to a dragon’s.
Apparently, they want to be able to transport a whole company of army troops and have them land in a personal flight suit to exterminate monsters after being issued an emergency.
There’s still no working airplane, but they are already talking big about dropping troops. It’s probably influenced by the successful introduction by Brother Grande to the Magic Knight Order of the thing, and that’s how they intend to implement those suits using a response team meant for dealing with monsters.
The improvement work on the flight suits continues even now, but unless you have a lot of mana, you are bound to crash using them.
For the ordinary infantry trooper, it’s unacceptable to take a lot of breaks, so it’s turned into a product that could only be used by a chosen elite.
So, it led to the introduction of an outrageous strategy of flying the infantry on an airplane, rushing them to the required place, and having them drop from the sky and finish the task under five minutes, since the result showed that an ordinary trooper can only use it for five minutes at maximum.
It seems that there will be one magician present to operate the engine of the airplane, which would be used in this strategy.
Fuel consumption would be so badddd.
Nevertheless, the better the propulsion system on the plane is installed, the less mana it will need to operate, which I think is quite effective. Brother, do your best!
After turning 15, I am finally able to live together with Teal under the same roof.
That royal villa will become the home for the crown prince’s family.
Lady Xior moved out and started to live in the palace proper.
It kinda feels like she lived here on a business trip while she taught me.
I am truly grateful to her, but I could have gone without the excessive pampering…
Anyway, tomorrow Teal will be coming here.
Hm, if I don’t reign him in, he will surely, as a response to not being able to meet me often, smother me to death with his hugs and whatever else.
Until after the wedding, I won’t allow anything more…
------------------ 
Chapter 125 – Just like that, the wedding ceremony is upon us“The marriage ceremony of the Karpf Theria Kingdom’s Crown Prince, His Highness Dotteal, and his fiancee, Lady Miranda from the house of Mirandiehl, shall now be held.”
Erm, so here I am today, in the church, standing together with Teal before the priest and about to say the words of vow that will tie us forever.
When the ceremony ends, I’ll officially become the Crown Princess, and after that, at the party, my new title will be announced before all of the nobility.
A week later, we will be paraded before the populace on a pure white convertible-type horse-drawn carriage.
During that time, there will also be various events, like exchanging greetings with the emissaries from every country we have relations with.
“Miranda Mirandiehl, do you swear your everlasting love to Dotteal Karpf Theria?”
Ah, it’s my turn.
“Yes, I swear.”
“Then, Dotteal Karpf Theria, do you swear to love and protect Miranda Mirandiehl now and forevermore?”
“I swear.”
Oh, today’s Teal is very calm and dignified.
He said that he put more effort into making himself prettier than usual.
In the end, his girlish face, depending on which make-up is added, can make him look like a real girl. So as to show the dignity of the royal family, when he goes out to public places, he always puts on appropriate make-up.
Well, thanks to Lisa’s work, I have proper make-up applied every day, which does make me look majestic, but I can’t escape the fate of having a youthful child’s appearance.
Lady Tolastina, who knows how I look normally, saw me in my crown princess makeup for the first time and burst out laughing.
That’s how big the gap between these two images of me is.
“Lady Miranda, is that you? Pfffft!!!”
When she asked me this, I was overcome with a desire to punch her in the gut.
Just where did her dignity as the future duchess go while she laughed at my expense?
Honestly, how rude can you be? Still, the look of wheezing with laughter unbecoming of a noble Lady Tolastina showed me quite clearly how she became brighter since the days of her taking a lot upon herself and stressing out.
It seems that Rabble supported her little girl’s hobbies and had one room of their house converted into the place where a lot of fancy plushies are stored.
It’s not good to hide the things you like from others forever.
“Here and now, in the Goddess’ name, the marriage of these two people loving each other is now regonized.”
Turning to everyone here, we bowed.
A loud applause rose in response to it.
Ah, we have finally done what we couldn’t in our past lives…
Sneaking a glance at Teal, I saw a big smile on his face.
Really, he’s the one who was more enthusiastic about the wedding.
Seeing him happy is the best.
No wonder, as I am wearing a pure white wedding dress today.
I didn’t ever think that I’d be wearing something like this.
It’s truly wonderful that a lot of dresses for women are very cute.
Well, I am guilty of bringing here quite a lot of modern designs for clothes.
Nevertheless, the 18th-century dresses are a way to go here still.
“Okay, Miranda. After this, at the castle, there will be a party announcing you as a crown princess. Will you be okay?”
“Yes, why do you ask?”
“Well, this will be your first time drinking, yeah?”
“I won’t drink until I’m sloshed, okay?”
“That’s not what I’m worried about. What bothers me is what will be after that…”
“Ya know, you really are faithful to your desires stemming from down there.”
“That’s because Miranda is cute.”
“I won’t let you bed me just like that, so prepare yourself.”
“What are you going to force me to dress up into…”
Teal had a distant look on his face, but that’s not my concern in the slightest.
In the previous world, we did have a bit of a close physical relationship, but, though it’s late already, it will be my first time like this.
I want to treasure the memories of my bridal night, after all.
Hah… So from now on, I will be royalty… I hope I can continue enjoying my girlish hobbies in the future…
------------------ 
Chapter 126 – The work of a member of the royal familyThe week after the unveiling party for the populace ended, I started doing work with Teal as a crown princess.
Bridal night? Ahhh, since he was so persistent after the wedding, I indulged him, yes.
Saying, “If you want it so badly, wear this,” I forced him to wear a dress with a miniskirt and wig.
I didn’t expect it to turn into a yuri play starring myself.
And hey, it was painful. I kinda hurt what shouldn’t be hurt quite hard.
Teal, sorry for me being me in our past lives…
It was quite difficult to comfort Teal, who was crouching then. I don’t mean it in a sexual way.
Nowadays, Teal does work as an assistant to the king in the country’s matters, and I support him in turn.
Teal is, well, lenient on the military.
Of course, the supreme commander of the military is His Majesty, but his aide, naturally, is Teal himself.
It’s just that, despite learning a lot of things concerning this, he still lacks the necessary knowledge.
Well, I myself haven’t read books about military affairs of the 18th century, and after I learned about what strategies are in use in this world that has magic since coming here, I always won in mock battles using live chess.
I love this kind of simulation game.
So, learning of this, the king declared, “Let’s leave the military matters to Miranda,” and I was given the position of Chief of Staff.
Sorry for my sudden intruding on you, dear uncles from the whole military.
“I am Miranda Karpf Theria. I am pleased to work with you all.”
“”””…””””
Oh, the marshals seem to be in a foul mood.
Well, of course. Who could accept, right off the bat, a small girl becoming an agent of the supreme commander?
There’s probably a lot of conservatives who don’t look kindly upon the Mirandiehl family, who are selling at a mad pace all those new weapons like airships and flight suits.
That said, some of the commission officers who have seen the terrifying results of the live chess mock battles I and Teal played, where we won 10 out of 10 battles in four of which we ended them without taking almost any losses, have started viewing us in a favorable light.
“Err, as everyone here knows, the family I hail from, the Mirandiehls, have recently started selling the technology to the Air Force, and I am sure that a lot of you are still doubting the effectiveness of it. At present, thanks to the diplomatic relations between countries working well to prevent military conflicts from occurring, we are now at peace, and so as to not suffer a failure in case of emergency, while the peace still holds, I think it behooves us to revise the military strategies and tactics. With that said, while me introducing myself at this conference is the main point of my being present here, let me urge everyone to see the mock battle for yourselves… What do you say?”
“I do not mind.”
The one who answered immediately was an officer from the AF. It still doesn’t have a marshal.
“This does not concern us at the Navy, does it?”
“No, this time not only the army, but we will also be including the navy to do a naval battle that often occurs between countries, so I would like you to attend.”
The marshal nodded, but his face clearly said, “What can a mere girl understand about the navy?”
I know it’s quite difficult to enact this kind of simulation with ships.
“The army does not mind it. So, how will the battle be conducted?”
“Then, I am currently thinking about making a unit out of the military personnel present here, so I would appreciate it if everyone could help me with the arrangements yourselves.”
“So be it.”
“Got it.”
After each of the marshals looked through the provided documents about the battle conditions, they all decided to participate.
“Then, just like this, I ask you to start the preparations.”
This live chess simulation war is the kind of game conducted by placing the pieces representing the army troops on a real field and rolling dice to determine the accuracy and movements of the pieces.
There’s infantry, artillery, magic knights, warships, patrol frigates, ships of the line, etc.
In today’s battle, I am sorry, but I had the “paddle steamer with a revolving turret” and “a flying boat improved from the aerial patrol airship” participate.
The former one, compared to the ships of the line, has infinitely fewer gunports, but to compensate, it is equipped with triple rifle turrets, with two of each placed on both the front and back.
The maximum number of guns is 24, though when facing sideways, the outer rim gets in the way, so the maximum number of firing guns is small.
Compared to the 150 guns the ships of the line are equipped with, it’s very underwhelming, but thanks to their ability to move in no-wind conditions and the development of the rifling, their accuracy and firing range were improved.
Moreover, you can fire in the direction of the ship’s movement.
Also, the flying boat, which is the next step in the development of an airplane, combines the hot-air balloon and magic jet propulsion with the wooden frame and needs a crew of three. The pilot, the mana provider, and the observer.
Though it’s wooden, the underside is armored, and it can withstand magic from guns shooting at it to some extent.
My family’s magic knight order can fly solo, but really, I want an escort plane for me here, but as there are still no airplanes, it cannot be helped.
The infantry is equipped with magic bolt-action guns, and the artillery uses magic cannons that are an improved version of those magic guns.
My opponents’ team, the marshals’ team, uses old musket-type magic guns and ordinary cannons for the artillery.
The navy made use mainly of the ships of the line. The AF… blimps.
Well, I am glad that they use new equipment, but it seems they are still having trouble operating it.
By the way, my troops have one weakness.
When throwing dice, misses will cost me dearly.
The reason is simple. These weapons are extremely new and have a lot of unresolved issues as a result, which can lead to problems.
It’s the worst thing that can happen to a weapon—not being able to work when it’s needed the most.
As I mentioned previously, a weapon that fails you at the most critical of times is a bad weapon, so please fix it as soon as possible.
Okay, let’s fight those bigwigs from the military.
I will definitely win! Yeah!
------------------ 
Chapter 127 – Imma beat ya up!The dice rolled with a clacking sound.
The combined numbers of those two thrown dices showed 18.
“With this, the Navy’s main fleet was sunk.”
“Kh!”
With this roll, the paddle steamer with a revolving turret crushed a ship of the line going at it from the front.
If it went literally “from the front,” it could have spelled big trouble if I were to get 15 on a dice roll and be bombarded by their one ship with 150 cannons if faced from the side.
Thanks to the AF’s reconnaissance out of their shooting range, that helped to pinpoint the location, and we barraged it continuously.
With my luck, I only got bad rolls two or three times and had some mistakes with positioning, but I pushed through somehow.
“Then, as the sea routes were successfully secured, I will be moving a transport ship with the 3rd Army Division onboard… Here, there’s 32 in total, and things seem to proceed smoothly.”
Thanks to that, I will now deploy my army at the rear of the main battlefield on the land, where the 1st and 2nd Divisions are currently in a stalemate.
An escort frigate is attached to the transport ship.
Unfortunately, as the latter is a sailing ship, there’s a problem with its dependency on the total rolls of the dice for its movement speed.
I so want a commando carrier.
“The 4th Division is still protecting the capital. There’s no need to worry.”
“Still, though the divisions from 1st through 3rd are in a standoff with Miranda’s army, the situation is quite strained.”
“Those damned AF… I thought that since they don’t have dragons, their attack is non-issue, but to think that the cooperation between the artillery and the aerial reconnaissance is such a thorn in our side.”
Well, while every marshal’s deployed army is currently in a standoff, to say it bluntly, they are now waging a trench war.
My opponents do use the hot-air balloons for recon, but since our airships enjoy high freedom of movement, the prediction of the enemy’s positions can be obtained more accurately from the data we get. Due to this, the artillery’s bombardment is quite accurate.
But since the shells we use are magical, the magical defense walls can obstruct them, and as a result, the enemy does not suffer major damage.
That’s why we are now at a standstill.
It’s dangerous for each side to forcibly charge.
As such, to break out of the current situation, the goal is to concentrate the main forces of the navy to forcibly open the way out, transport all divisions with them, and do a pincer attack on the land army.
“Still, to have this stand off in a battle of 2 divisions against 3…”
“Those new weapons, the bolt-action rifles’ rapid-firing is excellent, and you can fire from them while crawling. The old method of firing all at once while standing makes them very good targets for new weapon users.”
“I didn’t know this could lead to such a good defense.”
“A hit area’s minimization is very important.”
After that, the safely transported Miranda’s army, the 3rd Division, surrounded the marshals’ armies.
They threw a white flag to avoid being thoroughly annihilated.
My losses were five frigates from the 1st fleet and small injuries to three army companies.
The other side, aside from the destruction of their entire navy, didn’t suffer many losses, which was helped by surrendering after being surrounded.
“The princess is surprisingly knowledgeable in military affairs…”
“We’d need to give due consideration to the matter of updating our weapons.”
“For that, we must develop weapons that are less prone to failure. There’s a long way until guaranteed use safety. As they say, what a weapon needs is the ability to quickly provide the necessary firepower precisely when it’s needed.”
“So you also understand this, Your Highness… You are almost a warrior princess herself…”
“I am honored.”
Since that day, at the military conferences, at least in the upper echelons, the number of people looking at me derisively because of my being a woman has sharply decreased.
Women have also started being accepted in the military, thanks to my lending my help with the development of the equipment they use and my asking for help from Chris in making improvements to them.
The Karpf Theria Kingdom has become quite a developed country, hasn’t it?
Hey, is it really okay for me to remain the de facto leader of the whole military?
Recently, people have started calling me by the weird nickname Valkyrie Miranda… It’s so embarrassing!
------------------ 
Chapter 128 – From now on, I will continue enjoying girlish hobbiesHello everyone, I am Miranda Karpf Theria.
Nowadays, while dealing with military affairs, at the same time, I continue to cultivate my love for Teal.
While doing that, I developed a lubricant gel, and it sells like hot cakes practically everywhere.
But wait, why does Lady Xior need it?
Are you still doing what you can?
Why would you want a child younger than your grandchildren?
As luck would have it, I got pregnant and am living my life, getting a lot of guidance from the people working in the clinic.
Hah… Who would have thought I’d be having a child… No, there aren’t any physiological problems with that; it’s just a thought that came to me.
For the time being, it’s important to have a successor, be it a prince or a princess, as long as they are conceived and safely born in the future.
Also, Teal became extremely overprotective.
Well, it’s definitely better to be doing something than sitting on your hands.
Just don’t make me hole up in a room; let me take walks outside.
One year has passed since then.
The first child, a boy, was born without problems, and he will be the first prince, Coomedeal Karpf Theria.
Sigh. My son is a cafe. Lady Xior stubbornly refused to give up the right to give him a name.
Though my and Teal’s inability to come up with a name that’s not cringe-worthy played a role in that.
Some time after the delivery, Teal again started to beg me for another child, and when I asked just how many he wanted, the answer was “at least five,” which led to us having a spat.
Why won’t you think about the strain it will put on my body?
Well, it’s not like I am that against having another child, but I said that we will be using birth control until Codea is at least three years old.
Yeah, the contraception was also developed after trial and error.
When I did inspections in the capital’s red light district, I saw a lot of girls being cruelly laid off after contracting disease or being pregnant…
The one who led the development was the alchemist Lady Julie.
When I had a small talk with her about how it’s difficult to get myself wet and mentioned wanting this and that, it seems that she became quite hooked on developing sexual goods and generally doing important work in advancing the medical field as a result.
You will ask, how is it possible to do that in a world without natural resin, much less silicon? Magic really rocks.
In the meantime, the country was peaceful, and the democratization process went smoothly.
For the first time in history, general elections will be held shortly.
Members of the Citizens’ Assembly will be chosen then.
The day of complete transition to a constitutional monarchy is close.
By the way, Lisa also has a child and now does the nanny’s work.
I am ever so grateful for you being with me from the start until the end.
Ah, yes, Lady Tolastina too had her first child.
A very imposing girl, with the look of—how to say it—THE villainess you often think of.
Rabble himself has quite the upturned eyes, so the genetics played its role splendidly.
I am eager to see her growth, so please don’t make mistakes in her education, okay?
Also, Lady Cascia and Lady Margaret both got married.
I look forward to seeing their adorable children.
To this day, I am still called that god-of-war-sounding nickname and am responsible for the military’s maintenance.
If we don’t modernize as soon as possible, we will face problems later.
Today I am taking a walk to the hobby room we made with Lady Xior.
This has been my daily routine since I got pregnant.
It takes around five minutes from my room in the royal villa to the detached building located in the garden.
Then I go around it, going on a course of touring the garden, which usually takes around thirty minutes.
Office work often leads to one not moving their body much.
My, it’s rare to see Teal here.
“What happened, Teal? You aren’t often seen in this place.”
“I just thought that you’d be taking a stroll around this time.”
“That’s correct. So, why are you here?”
“So I can’t come home unless I have something to do?”
“Ah, yes, yes, you are here to relax.”
“That’s correct.”
I am sure he was stuck while doing his work.
“Now, spill it.”
“I just thought that recently I haven’t been able to leisurely talk with you.”
“That so? But we always have great conversations at night, don’t we?”
“That’s not what I mean.”
“Fufufu. I will be going to the building here now. Want to come with me?”
“Ah, right, let me impose on you this time.”
“What should I prepare for you today?”
“Can you clear out the room of maids?”
“Of course.”
I hide my mouth behind a spread fan.
Fufufu. I got it right—you want to come here to do cosplay and play with dolls or plush toys, right?
Let me accompany you on this joyous occasion.
Hahhh. I wondered what would happen to me when I got reborn as a woman, but I am glad that I met Teal like that and was able to marry him.
From now on, I will be able to both indulge in my girlish hobbies together with my husband and live out the life of a girl to the fullest!
------------------ 
EX1 – A duke’s daughter, Tolastina Arkray, thinks about the pastI am the future head of the Arkray family. My name is Tolastina.
Thanks to the help of my close friend and benefactor, crown princess Miranda, I was able to tie the knot with the person who was my first love, and currently, the Karpf Theria Kingdom experiences the so-called “love marriage boom.”
It should be noted, though, that the Arkrays and Rabble’s family are quite close in status, so the wedding didn’t meet much resistance and went smoothly.
I became friends with Lady Miranda when I attended a tea party at the palace, where the prince needed to decide on his fiancee.
As I tried a little forcefully to come at looking for a way to be removed from the status of a fiancee candidate, I saw a very small girl who sat on the other side of the prince, opposite from me.
I couldn’t believe that was the daughter of the Mirandiehl duke.
After that tea party, I was informed that I was chosen as a candidate right then and there.
From the perspective of family status, we both were strong contenders for the position, so in a way, this was already predetermined from the start.
If possible, I’d like to quit.
Even if I want to spend my whole life with Rabble, nothing can be done when the royal family requests anything from you.
Also, since my family is right-leaning, were I to become a queen in the future, the nobility could have become even more influential, but alas, the times have changed, and it’s the age of democratization.
I certainly do not want to become a queen at such an important point in history.
Living day-to-day with this anxiety in my heart, I received a letter from the Mirandiehls.
Lady Miranda asked for a direct meeting and discussion.
I thought, “This is my chance!”  A chance to proudly declare my unwillingness to be a prince’s fiancee.
On the promised day, I went to visit the Mirandiehl family’s townhouse.
When I performed the aristocratic greeting, Lady Miranda, a mere seven-year-old child, responded to me in kind.
I wasn’t that good with my words when I was her age two years ago, was I?
“Let us proceed to my room immediately.”
And with this declaration, I was taken into the depths of the enemy territory, or rather, their main camp, by Lady Miranda.
I had my guards following me, and while being shown around, I noticed just how graceful she was as she walked.
You could practically feel the results of her education oozing off of her.
On the other hand, look at me, who, unless I strain myself to keep my composure, will surely expose my inadequacy…
She is more than suited to be the prince’s fiancee compared to me.
I must, no matter what, tell her that I am not interested in that position…
When I first saw Lady Miranda’s room, I felt like I had started seeing a daydream.
No one could blame me for suddenly wanting to break into a smile.
I am not envious that her room was almost drowned in “plushies” or anything!!!
Moreover, Lady Miranda seems to be making her own stuffed toys, as she placed before me the toys made based on the characters from the popular novel “Sages of the Round Table.”
Their cute miniaturized versions were so pretty that I wanted to take them in my hands and cherish them as long as I could… But I resisted the temptation and tried to turn the discussion to the topic of being a fiancee. Lady Miranda let out a cry unbecoming of an aristocrat and acted very surprised.
She seems to have thought that I aimed to become the prince’s fiancee and was fully prepared to give up on the role.
No, let me be the one to hand over the position to you.
After explaining my circumstances, Lady Miranda was convinced almost immediately.
Ordinary people almost always marry their loved ones, but nobles cannot afford to do the same.
But she said that she would support my love.
When I proposed the strategy of making a united front to make the prince hate us, I was rejected.
It seems she tried to think of another way.
Then, just as we started to be more relaxed with each other, Lady Miranda said something so outrageous that it was my turn to be shocked.
“By the way, you do really like the stuffed toys, do you not?”
“Uhm… w, well…”
I don’t think it was weird that I couldn’t give a straight answer to that question.
Hearing me, she suddenly had people vacate the room we were in.
When the maid that was with me left the room last, she said a really surprising thing.
“Heh, heh, heh. Lady Tolastina! Let us be healed together with the plushies while others aren’t here!”
I could not believe what I was hearing.
Still, Lady Miranda’s proposition was very attractive.
Being told that it’s alright to dive into a mountain of plushies—who could resist that?
I went and tenderly hugged the biggest bear-stuffed toy that was in the room.
“Ahhh, this embrace is healing my soul.”
After that, we took turns hugging various plushies there, which brought me huge comfort.
Also, I really wanted those Sages’ toys for myself, and imagine my surprise when Lady Miranda said that she made them herself.
Who could have thought that this would be the case at all?
And then she gave me one as a souvenir.
What a big-hearted person!
I immediately became her fan from this point on.
Later, stuffed toys modeled after the sages of the round table, called “nui,” started to be sold.
Due to their immense popularity, they were quite hard to obtain, and at first, merchants who charged exorbitant sums from those who wanted to buy the toys started to appear.
I was able to get one with a friend’s discount.
I put those cute and cool sages’ nuis in my secret room on display.
Until my official marriage with Rabble, I paid visits to Lady Miranda’s home and invited myself to dive into the mountain of plushies she had there.
Especially since I started school, so as to deal with my anxieties about Rabble’s growing popularity there, I have often visited the Mirandiehl house.
The plain and very real goblin plush was my favorite.
I truly wanted to get it and take it home with me, but I couldn’t ask this of her.
It seems that it was a handmade toy someone made, so there’s nowhere to buy them, and I gave up on trying to get my hands on it.
Some time after she became an adult and started to live in the palace proper, Lady Miranda sent me a letter asking, “Won’t you come to visit the small detached building I had asked to construct in the palace’s garden?”
There was no mistake; that place could only be one thing.
A hobby room, if I were to elaborate.
The room turned out to be several times more crazier than the one Lady Miranda had at her home, which I visited previously.
Dollhouses, plushies, dolls, and stands for mock strategic battles giving off eerie light lined the whole room.
As expected, when I asked about the presence of the latter, a war game that all military officers were quite fond of, Lady Miranda said that it’s also one of her hobbies.
I don’t think that it is a hobby suited to ladies… Even though Arkrays have their people in the navy, I didn’t receive an education focused on those affairs.
Recently, all upper echelons of the military seem to be thoroughly beaten at this game by her.
How terrifying…
But what was most scary was her declaring that this room would be open free of charge to any noble daughter wanting to play it.
I am sure there are a lot of girls who’d want to come and see… Would it not be great to have foreign princesses come here?
With my interest in having similar room spiking, I thoroughly explaned to Rabble everything and had an annex at our mansion built.
This will bring me the utmost joy in beautifully arranging and admiring while having tea the various plushies I have secretly amassed to this day.
Also, Lady Miranda became pregnant with a child, so we, her friends, need to try our best with the same soon.
I am now filled with determination to have my child be either a close aide or a future bride for Lady Miranda’s child.
------------------ 
EX2 – Our milady is quite weirdMy name is Lisa Purple.
I am the second daughter of the Purple Viscount family serving the Mirandiehl ducal family of the Karpf Theria Kingdom.
As a servant of that family, I am responsible for taking care of their only daughter, Lady Miranda.
I think calling myself her personal maid would be easier to understand.
At 21 years old, I am at the age when I need to start looking for a spouse, and even though I did entertain the notion of making it big by marrying the second son of the Mirandiehls, Lord Grande, when I only started working for them, now I don’t feel like that anymore as I have fallen in love with Alec Magenta, an heir to a viscount family also working for the duke.
I am slowly but surely getting closer to my marriage with him.
Now then. Lady Miranda, whom I serve, is quite a good student, blessed with a large mana pool, and despite being only nine, she has developed new products and is quite skilled at running the finances of the faction her family leads.
I am sure that the above is the reason why I think this: “However you look at it, she’s quite weird.”
I cannot say it out loud, but that’s how I think.
At seven, when she made those adorable miniaturized plush toys she called “nui,” basing their designs on characters from novels, she gave me a shock I won’t ever forget in my life.
Are you really a seven-year-old child? I cannot decide if you have some knowledge of those things you heard from someone or if you are really that vulgar, knowing precisely what you talk about…
Anyway, with her being a person who sometimes does things one does not expect from people her age, this time I got caught up in a terrifying plan she concocted.
Plan to make His Highness Dotteal her dress-up doll.
I got worried if we would be charged with lese majeste… But Lady Miranda said:
“It’s alright; don’t worry. You know that if I were to try and undress him alone, it would lead to a worsening of our reputations, right? Help me with this.”
And that was it.
Certainly, even though she’s his fiancee, it’s bad to have an unmarried man and woman show each other partially their skin or be half-naked behind closed doors.
But what, in my opinion, was more dangerous was her trying to dress the prince in drag.
Usually, Lady Miranda calls him by his pet name, and everyone knows how close they are, though I can’t help but worry if this is really alright to do.
Still, regardless of my concern, she, using the measurements from clothes the prince wears that she got from who knows where, called the dressmaker Lady Rui and, after giving her the designs she came up with herself, requested to make clothes for the prince to wear.
Though, as these clothes would be used for fun, there was no need to be particular about what material to use, which led to it being quite cheap, and as a result of asking not to leave a record of their making, there we were.
We didn’t inform her for whom those clothes would be made, but as Lady Rui handles the prince’s formal wear and other clothes, I am sure she had an inkling as to who it was for when she heard the measurements…
Nevertheless, I am a little excited to participate in this scheme.
His Highness Dotteal is quite known for his feminine features, after all.
To tell the truth, there are quite a lot of female enthusiasts out there who would really like to have him wear a lot of different clothes and generally play with him as their dress-up doll since he’s so adorable.
Of course, these talks are reserved for speaking about in private.
When meeting my friends, I end up discussing this as I see the prince’s face up close often.
This is also my belief… that dresses suit him.
And so, on the day of His Highness’s arrival.
With excitement filling my heart, I went to greet him with Lady Miranda.
They talked quite animatedly.
It seemed that they had forged a secret agreement beforehand, and the prince said that there’s no need to worry about being charged with offending the royal.
When he asked if he should have it written, I refused with all my might.
It’s scary to have my involvement in this documented.
Still, Lady Miranda was very eager.
I never thought the day when I would strip His Highness together with her would ever come.
This is something I won’t ever admit to, but I secretly left records of what happened there.
I really don’t want to take this secret with me to the grave.
Anyway, the prince dressed in drag turned out to be prettier than me.
I cannot comprehend this.
That said, I was able to see a rare sight of Lady Miranda sincerely smiling from the bottom of her heart.
Incidentally, I also saw a very unsettling smile.
I am not sure what they were talking about, but seeing the quite disappointed-looking prince who gazed at Lady Miranda like that, it must have been something really serious.
After that, they had a couple more dresses worn, but the garment, which Milady had secretly prepared and that could only cover a small area of the body, was sealed away the moment I saw it.
Seeing the thing boggled my mind.
I thought it was underwear. Alas, I wasn’t able to hear what kind of wear it was, however.
In three years, Lady Miranda will go to the academy, and after graduating there, she will be taken into the palace, so I will be serving as her attendant for about six more years.
An attendant to this person, who usually behaves with ladylikeness not suitable for her age and only shows her true face after taking off her mask at home, and the people whom she trusts only.
Thinking about her becoming our future queen, I am filled with mixed feelings about all this today too.
------------------ 
EX3 – An aide’s doubtsMy name is Earlgrey, from the Coffeemocca count family.
Last year, I graduated at the top of my class from the nobles’ school.
That’s where I was noticed by His Highness Dotteal.
He attended the presentation of my graduation thesis, and after seeing what I presented, “A possibility of citizens attaining the right of self-governance,” he recruited me.
Since I am good with Fire magic, I can also work as his guard.
I haven’t been able to find a person to love while studying at the school.
As a third son, I can’t be a successor to the family’s fortune.
Fortunately, even though there was nobody to try and hit on me, a mere viscount, after His Highness took me in, my world has changed.
Heh, besieged from all fronts, I am!
There’s “almost” no girl that would approach the prince, who already has a fiancee.
That’s because any lady would look inferior if she tried to stand beside the cool and collected prince’s figure.
Only one lady, the Mirandiehl daughter, with her fair looks, won’t lose to him in this, and since their flirting full of mutual love is obvious to everyone, there’s also no guy who tries to approach her either.
In fact, when boys call out to her with this kind of intention, she runs away.
I would really like to learn this technique of suddenly disappearing from you.
Just the other day, the aforementioned duke’s daughter, Lady Miranda, came to our office for a visit.
Apparently, she had her doubts but was quickly assuaged after learning the reason why girls do not approach His Highness.
And anyway, since he quite often goes on and on about Lady Miranda, it will make anyone curious to get to know her, but after meeting with her, I thought the girl was a model noble lady.
His Highness always stated what a proper lady she is, but I thought she was head and shoulders above other girls.
That’s why I wasn’t surprised by her desire to know what work we do here and didn’t question it, but seeing her heated discussion with the prince about the newest technologies developed, I couldn’t believe my eyes.
Well, the moment she was convinced that I and Darjeen were chosen for our merits, it made me wonder, “Just what kind of person is she?”
As I mentioned earlier, at parties, I am now surrounded by girls, but of course, they are from the same faction we are.
Being a possible candidate for the post of Prime Minister, those ladies, the greedy gold diggers they are, all flock to me.
It’s hard to say it myself, but I believe that my face isn’t bad-looking, so I want to have faith that they don’t want my title…
By the way, talking about factions, everyone had a nice time without prejudice.
I was quite surprised to witness her talking normally with Darjeen, who, as it stands, is from the faction opposing hers.
Anyway, Lady Miranda threw a literal bombshell at us later.
A couple days after our first meeting, she gave us a proposal for paving roads with concrete.
What’s more, she said, “I leave everything on you,” so nonchalantly.
It’s like she didn’t even have the slightest inclination to be involved herself.
To begin with, she, using the format of a proposal created by His Highness, diligently put all required materials together and attached all documents as needed.
Is she really an ordinary noble girl?
There’s something wrong with her head for being a lady who doesn’t have an interest in gossip or pretty dresses, unlike those usually raised as delicate flowers.
Thanks to that, we got really busy.
Being exclusively assigned to work together with the Mirandiehl heir, Lord Tosted, and Marquess Saintgeorges, who mines gypsium in his territory, makes me want to die.
Rather, where did this all even come from?
With my interest piqued, I did an investigation, and though it was somehow hidden, after catching sight of Karpf Theria Kingdom’s enactment of the MIS, a so-called industrial standard, I got to know that the tomatoes that started to be offered in the castle were instructed to be grown by none other than Lady Miranda.
Adding to that, she’s also the originator of the Goth Miranda brand that’s popular with the girls of our generation nowadays, and the start of dolls and nuis culture were too thanks to her.
It seems that she has introduced quite a lot of things ever since she was a small child.
She may be a genius who births new industries just like that.
I did wonder if the prince is really eleven, but to think that a girl who’s younger than him by two years could be so proactive and innovative.
Just how does her mind work?
I would really like to have a lengthy talk about this with her.
------------------ 
EX4 – Michelle Karpf Theria shuts herselfMy name is Michelle. The first princess of the Karpf Theria Kingdom.
Miranda is the name of my mother, and Dotteal is the name of my father.
I, who am now ten years old, just the other day remembered “my past life’s memories,” and being overwhelmed by this, I am currently hiding in a room in the hobby building that my mother had built.
In my past life, I was a student, though, as circumstances have it, I became a recluse, playing her favorite otome game over and over again.
And while I did that, I ended up reincarnating at some point.
Into this fantasy world of swords, magic, and guns.
My Mother was very kind, if a little peculiar in her sensibilities and a bit off-putting.
And my Father had a strange maternal disposition to him. Such was a tad weird family I grew up surrounded by, where I quickly matured. At the tea party during my tenth birthday celebration the other day, I remembered the mother’s hobby room I was shown and where I currently am.
Mother and Father tried to call out to me with worried voices, but I am not sure how I should meet them now or how to look at them after all this…
And hey, forgive me for being blown away after knowing that my father’s and brother’s names are the same as the names of famous cafe chains.
As a first princess, even though I am hiding here now, there are knights guarding me outside the building, and the maids bring food for me to eat.
I feel bad for having this lifestyle that’s more than any hikikomori can dream of.
Also, I cannot comprehend why in this room there are quite a lot of “nuis” here, which I collected in my past life.
There’s nuis of knights and princes from the picture books I read when I was small… Some of them were placed in sets of top and bottom, so I can clearly see what you did there, mother…
I am being corrupted… It’s too late… Hey, it really was very quick!
I know how to make the most of this! I even did this! In my past life, I did this kind of thing really often!
“Michelle~ You are there, right? Let’s talk a little.”
Finally, my mother came here.
And anyway, she’s the one who owns this room, and though I locked the door, she can find a way to get in here, so I guess it’s the end of my holing up…
Being left alone for ten days is already generous… Still, how should I explain this… Who would believe me when I say that I remembered my past life a couple days ago?
Turning around to the sound of clanking, I saw Mother standing there.
Honestly, despite having two kids already, she still looks quite young… How, mother?
“Hm… So Michelle is El x Al stan. Is this war?”
“Eh, wha?”
When I was turning around, I had in my hands the nuis of the magician Elude and knight Alfred from a certain novel.
In my opinion, Al should be at the top and El should be at the bottom.
Even though I shut myself in, as there’s no video games in this world, I was engrossed in playing with nuis by myself, but it seems I was exposed.
But wait, what do you mean by war, mother?
“Er… M, Mother.”
“I had doubts if this could be true or not when I heard the reports about you, but judging by your reaction… Michelle. You have memories of your past life, right?”
“Ugh.”
Watching my reaction, my mother, biding her escorts to leave, entered the hobby room.
“Surprised? Learning of the similarity in the names of your father and brother to famous shops, and despite the world being kinda medieval, there’s some modern culture here.”
“Err, well, erm…”
“Ah, there’s no point in hiding it now. I and Teal are both former Japanese with memories of our past lives. Seeing how you play with toys by yourself, I was convinced that you are the same. I don’t have recollections of ever teaching you the way you did play with nuis.”
What the heck?! I was watched from the start?!
Hey, so both mother and father have memories of their past lives?! For real?!
“Also, I am the one who made the dolls and nuis popular here. Okay, so shall we start the hostilities?”
“I am deeply sorry for my actions.”
I immediately kneeled before Mother.
Going off the templates of this genre, getting into fights with the pioneers in a field never yielded good results.
So my mother is the opposite of me, huh? I do like my strong-willed men to be on the receiving side… Ain’t that how it should be?
“Well, okay. Shippings depend on a person. A lot of girls have their own preferences. Hey, what genres did you like before? I liked works aimed at little girls. What media were you into? Can you tell me?”
Mother, you are being scary with your pushiness.
And she already talks to me like having memories of another world is an established fact.
Are you alright there?
What would you have done if it turned out that I wasn’t like you thought?
“Mother, did you never consider that I could not have my past life memories at all?”
“Would you think that, seeing your daughter wanting to go take a bath?”
“Ah.”
“Taking a bath is a part of Japanese culture. Moreover, this country doesn’t have this custom. By the way, at present, Teal tries to make a bath at the royal palace. And I am in the middle of making a bathing duck.”
“Mother, isn’t the direction of your efforts kind of weird?”
“I prefer to say that I am doing my best for the sake of my hobbies.”
“Ah, yes.”
After that, I asked my mother about her past life and told her about my own.
Wow, my mother was a man before… And my father was a woman… It kinda makes sense now.
Mother having control of all the military cliques, too, makes a lot of sense.
What a disparity it is for a military otaku to like girlish things.
What’s more, she’s now developing machine guns and armored cars.
Just where does she intend to go to war… Even though it’s for national defense, it’s clearly overkill for “current” times…
After this heart-to-heart conversation with her, with my mother saying, “Isn’t it alright as it is now?” we left the hobby room together.
I really did live a reclusive life for ten days straight.
Moreover, to get up to speed with my princess education for the days I hid myself, I was forced to study at a tremendous pace in all those courses on manners and whatever else.
Though I had my free time spent relaxing by talking with Mother and Father about anime and manga we liked in our past lives.
Also, Mother declared, “You can do whatever you like with whatever concerns your hobbies.”
As a result, I, too, have started thinking about what kind of toys from the previous world I can bring into this one.
At present, I am having trouble finding a way to recreate acrylic stands.
------------------ 
EX5 – Michelle Karpf Theria reflects on the world around herNot only my mother, but also my father, were reincarnators.
What’s more, both of them have changed sexes after transmigrating here.
This all made a lot of things click for me.
I started to pay attention to what was around me when I was around 5 or 6.
Sometimes there would be thoughts popping in my head, “Isn’t this royal family kinda strange?”
It’s not that rare for a king to be helped with deciding the course of a country’s politics by someone, and in the current Karpf Theria Kingdom, my father, the king, is responsible for domestic affairs, and my mother, the queen, is responsible for diplomatic relations and national defense.
In other countries, it’s the opposite.
Well, the king does look after the domestic affairs, but, like many nobles say, “Women should take care of the house, and men should take care of what’s outside it,” it doesn’t happen all that often.
That’s why, after being taught in princess education how it’s in other countries, my feelings of something being out of place only grew.
Especially when I was a small child, I liked Mother (well, it’s par for the course when you’re young, right), and so I often accompanied her on military inspections, but at those times, she did her inspections dressed in cool black uniform-like clothes that had a skirt attached to them.
Anyway, any little girl would be bored with all those visits.
As expected, it was the same for me, though seeing magic knights flying in the sky to and fro fascinated me, and I respected my mother for being able to speak surrounded by mean-looking army leaders without an ounce of fear to her.
Also, the sight of my mother being the usual victor in war games she played with my brother is burned in my mind forever.
By the way, father was also trounced by mother in the game.
I guess you can say it’s rare to see such a well-versed in military things woman… At that time, I should have started to have suspicions.
Still, the usual mother is a very girly girl, with a youthful look and attractiveness not usually found in women with two children, and she dearly loved dolls and stuffed animals, which I also like.
Particularly, a yellow bear plush that my mother made was my favorite.
But mother… Now, thinking about it, you have created quite a scary thing. A yellow bear, even if there’s no life to it, still frightens me… Should I be grateful that it wasn’t a mouse, at least?
Also, there’s a brand that my mother started. The Goth Miranda clothes are very popular in the capital nowadays.
Young ladies from the royal faction will always try to add to the dresses various ornaments, though there are some things that are quite cheap and can be bought by commoners to wear.
And yet, Mother herself tries her hardest not to wear those clothes… What’s with that?
Still, Mother… You really brought here gothic lolita style, known in Japan as lolita fashion, huh…
That said, I feel like the two-piece military uniform she wore during the inspections reminded me of the designs of military gothic dresses… And my mother had no problem wearing those.
That reminds me that there exists a gynecology department, but, contrary to my belief, it was my father who suggested it and had it created instead.
Apparently, he spearheaded this research so that my mother, who was a man before, wouldn’t have to suffer an ill fate.
Though that wasn’t publicly announced, and so the one to bear all responsibility was my mother.
You’ve got it tough, Mother… I am sure it was hard for you to have discussions about that…
Still, it’s now possible for ladies to consult with doctors about the problems women usually have, and the birthrates have gone up.
The family my mother comes from, the Mirandiehls, is considered home for healthcare and aviation and was granted the title of Grand Duke.
Well, the reason for that was, again, my mother, and so in this world that doesn’t even have proper railways, we already have strategic bombers and escort fighters.
The gynecology department fits into the view of being a home for healthcare, but when I heard about aviation, I didn’t understand the reason for that at first.
When I was born, the idea that “magic knights are those who fly the skies” had become almost universally understood, but I didn’t know that my mother was the originator of that belief.
Furthermore, she’s also the one behind the foundation on which the engines of the recently introduced passenger aircraft were based.
The one who created them was a magic tool craftsman working for the Mirandiehls, Lady Chris.
Thanks to her contributions, she’s now a female count.
If memory serves, during her student time, she was a “lady” from a baron family.
Quite the rise in the ranks, indeed…
On the outskirts of the capital, there’s the joint airport for both international flights and AF use, which currently carries people to other countries.
What’s more, there also exists a VTOL for the royal family’s exclusive use… I do know that it’s controlled through magic, but this thing is quite scary for being able to carry passengers.
After asking my mother, she told me that she could fly alone to any country on the continent.
Did you try it already? Mother!
Eh? If you’re solo, you can exceed the speed of sound??? Mother… It’s not something that the queen should be doing in any case!
Moreover, the engines are never taken out of the country, and we are the only place where they could be made. The Mirandiehl territory, which was a prosperous trade port, is now mainly focused on the major industries of making seacraft and aircraft.
Steam engines, where are they???
The jet engines, being magical tools, had made it possible for large sea vessels using hydrofoil or jet propulsion to appear, and the other day, when going on an inspection of the Navy, I was able to see a plan for making a jet-propelled ship reminiscent of the battleship Yamato.
Mother… Are you planning on taking control of the continent’s seas and skies with just one country?
Also, it seems that she thought a lot about weapons for the land war, and I heard her grumbling about wanting to create armored personnel carriers and tanks, but the developments aren’t going smoothly despite them being done.
It seems that the jet engine mother proposed doesn’t have an axial compressor, so it cannot be made into a turbine.
Well, it’s not like I am that knowledgeable about that stuff…
Don’t look at me with those eyes full of expectations, mother. I am a proud humanities person, so stop it.
After being dragged out of the room I hid in by my mother and reflecting on the life I led these past ten years, I was convinced again that the most eccentric person I ever saw is my mother.
These days, I am thinking that instead of developing acrylic stands, it’s better to make a wooden board with elaborately drawn pictures you can take with you anywhere, but will I be okay after that… I wonder?

EX6 – Illustration Corner!My friend, Kohano-sensei (https://twitter.com/k0han0ars), has drawn the illustration based on how they imagined it reading my work: “Since I have been reincarnated as the daughter of a duke, I, the “girl inside,” will enjoy being a girl as much as I can!”
Thank you!!!
Thank you for drawing a very cute picture of Miranda.
The image depicts her as around 13 to 15 years old.
*The artist for the manga version is another person, so be aware of the differences.
------------------ 
EX7 – The list of characters appearing in Mental OtomeThe protagonist
A duke’s daughter, Miranda Mirandiehl.
An ordinary man had been reincarnated as a girl with platinum blond hair and emerald green eyes. The original Miranda was “repeating her life at a certain timing.” The reason for her repeating life is unknown. The reincarnated Mirada decided to live her life as she pleases and, using and, in a sense, abusing her knowledge, immersed herself in her girlish hobbies. In addition, she is a military otaku and, as a result, had a hand in the reform of the military.
Father
Duke Baker Mirandiehl.
A prime minister, who, after his daughter lost her memories when being ill with a high fever, put all his efforts into reforming medical care. In later years, he will be called the father of the healthcare revolution. He’s very particular about money. As a marquess’s son originally, he’s Lady Margaret’s real uncle.
Mother
Miran Mirandiehl (she’s the daughter of this family).
She married Mr. Baker after falling in love with him. Like Miranda, she likes girlish things. As a result of wanting to surprise her husband on their 10th wedding anniversary, she became pregnant with Miranda. The family didn’t want her to marry into the royal family.
Eldest brother
Tosted Mirandiehl.
The lord of Mirandiehl territory. Officially, Duke Baker is the head of the family, but the one responsible for managing the territory is him. No wonder, as his father is busy being the prime minister. That’s why he didn’t appear often in the story. He deeply cares for Miranda and has a girly face similar to that of his mother. That’s why a lot of potential spouses ran on him… Who would want a husband who’s more beautiful than them? When Miranda proposed the ore mining, he was able to find a partner in the eldest daughter of the Saintgeorges.
Older brother
Grande Mirandiehl.
A knight of the Magic Knight Order. He looks like his father. He got married to a maid working in the palace, whom he got to know through the Order. Thanks to Miranda’s flight, he has become the first flying magic knight. After that, he became a flying trainer for knights of the Order.
Maid
Lisa (a viscount daughter).
Served as Miranda’s maid until the end. Also, she’s an accomplice in the incident with the undressing of the prince. Had been afraid of being accused of lese majeste for doing that.
Head maid
Auntie Stella (a count’s daughter, 45 years old).
The one who was responsible for giving lessons on a lady’s education to Miranda.
Classroom lesson teacher
Sara Fielie, a baron’s wife.
Had a fun time teaching Miranda, who was quick to understand the material.
Teacher of magic
Patine Snore, the grandpa-teacher.
Currently, he keeps close to his heart the information about how Miranda was able to turn defense magic into offense magic.
Dressmaker
Rui Ballcook, a viscount’s daughter (currently a commoner).
A dressmaker who got caught up in Miranda’s schemes. Previously, she had the weird nickname “dresses incarnate,” and before she knew it, she had become known as a “gothic lolita goddess.” But she herself didn’t ever wear those dresses. An amazing person able to make Miranda’s novel designs into masterpieces.
Daugther of royalists
Margaret Schutted, a marquess’ daughter.
Her family is the actual family of the Father. When Goth Miranda was opened, she became its biggest patron and shopkeeper. Always wears gothic lolita dresses. Usually wears black and white ones.
Karpf Tetra Duke’s faction (center-left), the Fire Magic, is their strong point
Cascia Saintgeorges, a marquess’ daughter.
The highest-ranked lady of the Karpf Tetra faction. Without noticing, she became a friend of Miranda’s. Even though she doesn’t speak about it often, she very much likes dolls. The Saintgeorges family is known for their mines.
Count Farhas Freima
A teacher at the school teaches Fire attribute magic. Sorry, I haven’t come up with any background for him other than this.
Arkray Duke’s faction (center-right), Wind attribute magic
Tolastina Arkray, a duke’s daughter
A red-haired lady with slanted eyes from an opposing faction. Looks like a perfect villainess. She adores plush toys. It seems her love for them will have been unchanged her whole life. She especially likes to throw herself into mountains made of stuffed toys. She quite often frequents Miranda at her home to heal the stress of being a noble lady with plushies. Thanks to that, despite being from the opposite faction, she hasn’t been bothered about that. It’s truly probable that the Karpf Theria Kingdom is now at peace wholly due to the friendship of Tolastina and Miranda.
Rabble Simons, a marquess’ son (second), is soon to be a navy officer.
Lady Tolastina’s fiancé. They would safely marry in the future. He’s very bad at talking with girls, but thanks to seeing Teal in drag, he got used to them. This led to him being immensely popular with girls, which in turn gave a lot of stress to Tolastina. But he stayed resolute in his love for her.
Count Morgen Gering (AF commander).
A person who fears for his health after being suddenly made a commander. Even though he’s from the Arkray faction and not that of a high rank, he’s now experiencing difficulties carrying out the important role he was bestowed with. But with his pay increase, he now can’t oppose Miranda, who was the one to create the Air Force.
His Majesty the King
Shahschalk Yassui Karpf Theria (the user of all attributes).
Thinking about it, he didn’t really appear in the story… I only came up with the name for him…
His Highness the Prince
Dotteal Karpf Theria (Teal).
Miranda’s former girlfriend. He’s very glad to have a girly face in this world. Before meeting with Miranda, he was very worried about his future. Has the personality of taking everything upon himself. Jealous of Miranda’s devil-may-care attitude. Still, he’s very glad for her being able to do everything that helped Miranda deal with all the problems that occurred.
Her Majesty the Queen
Exschelxior Karpf Theria (previously Exschelxior Karpf Tetra).
Teal takes after her in looks. After colluding with Miranda, she successfully built a hobby lounge on the palace’s grounds. An old friend of Duchess Miran.
The prince’s confidants
Earlgrey Coffeemocca, a count’s son, became a candidate for prime minister.
Darjeen Assam, a marquess’ son, became a candidate for minister of military affairs.
Founding team of the gynecology department
Alchemist: Julie West, a count’s daughter.
Pharmacist: Light Bigsky, a viscount’s wife.
Daughter doctor: Rin Divella.
Mother doctor: Viola Divella.
------------------ 
EX8 – Chris McCain’s musingsIf I were to say what was the biggest influence in half of my life, I’d answer—meeting Lady Miranda Mirandiehl from the same faction I am…
No, meeting the reigning queen, Her Majesty Miranda Karpf Theria.
Lady Miranda always asks me to refer to her as “Miss Mirada” in person, but during these musings, from our position standpoint, I will be referring to her as Lady Miranda.
I met her while attending the school for nobles.
Lady Miranda often said that I was a “baron’s daughter with soft and fluffy pink hair that looks like a small animal.”
By the way, now I am a countess.
Funny, isn’t it? A girl adopted by a baron’s family now has that title…
This is all Lady Miranda’s fault.
At the time, while getting the basic education necessary for a noble daughter before enrolling, I repeated the learned material again, which turned out to be easy, and before I knew it, I got enrolled in the highest-ranked class in school.
Even when I was a commoner, I learned from my mother the craft of magic tool making, and suffice to say, I was discovered by Lady Miranda during an exposition last year where we showed a magic gun we developed.
The number of girls in that high-ranked class, where the most learned gather, was five, and two of them were nobles.
Despite the school being called as such, it’s a place for nurturing future officials; that’s why even commoners can study there.
I met Lady Miranda on the second day after the entrance ceremony.
In the classroom we went after the ceremony, with male students’ eyes clearly saying, “a mere woman,” and in addition, with noble male students regarded me as a “big-headed former commoner,” I tried to make myself smaller, and when the homeroom ended, I desperately wondered what to do. Just then, I was straight-on approached by the very gracefully moving daughter of a duke.
Trying to make myself seem smaller, I thought that’d be my death. She elegantly called out to me, and while I sat there surprised, she whisked me to the cafeteria, ordered food for us both, and after that, we ended up becoming friends.
Let me tell you exactly what happened.
While confused as to what occurred, it was not something simple, like being in the sights of a high-ranking noble or being surrounded by them.
Until His Highness the Prince appeared, I felt detached from what was around me. That was when I learned what true despair is.
Now then, the Mirandiehl family is from the royalist faction, and the McCain family is, too.
It seems that that family is the one that provides magic tool craftsmen to high-ranked nobles of the faction, and the previous head of the family is the one working as a personal crafstman of the Mirandiehls.
An old man I have never met in my life…
So, after the meeting with Lady Miranda, my life went crazy.
First, let me tell you about the gun improvement.
Being humbled by the breadth of her knowledge, I immediately agreed to the idea of her being at the top of the class.
And just when I vaguely thought that the guns would be her work for graduation papers… hearing the same year, “Lady Miranda flew in the sky,” I bet you, like I did, don’t understand what I’m saying, but, yes, she literally flew in the sky.
Looking at that, I really couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing at that moment.
What’s more, I seem to remember being really dizzy when asked to turn that magic she used into a magic tool.
As it turned out, the principle was very simple.
Using both Wind and Fire magic, compressed air was heated, and, after expanding, its counterforce caused flight.
Going by Lady Miranda’s words, it was the birth of the “jet engine.”
When I made an experimental personal flight magic tool using a set of five jet engines, that’s what became my graduation project.
During that time, I became Lady Miranda’s personal magic tool craftsman and was bestowed the rank of baroness.
The engine with increased output that could be installed on airplanes for AF’s use was also the one we developed together.
With the speed surpassing the dragon’s, the next month I was promoted to viscountess.
In addition, due to my involvement in the development projects of the strategic bomber, its escort fighter, civilian transport plane/passenger plane, and the royal family’s aircraft, I worked on the designs for the engines those crafts use.
As I said previously, it uses quite simple magic, but it seems that nobody besides me understood the principle, so even if someone tried to draw the same magic circuits, it’s impossible to produce a jet engine for them.
Nevertheless, Lady Miranda suggested we develop a low-noise engine. When I improved the designs by adding a separate uncompressed airflow from the outside and changing the form of the jet pit, I suddenly became a countess.
Going up three ranks in one generation… What’s this even?
Thanks to that, I still can’t find a marriage partner!
A former commoner! Who went up three noble ranks! Becoming the first countess of the Karpf Theria Kingdom!
No gentlemen approach me due to all that!!!
No, that’s enough. I’ve already given up.
My “looks” are still regarded as cute, but the moment I introduce myself, all noble men get away from me as fast as they can!
A bunch of small-minded fools!
Regarding that, Lady Miranda had some thoughts of her own and half-jokingly said to me, “If you want a child, how about I lend you Teal?” When he heard that, he could only shake his fist at her.
What are you even saying, Lady Miranda… Everyone around you can see just how close you are as a couple, so I will decline your proposal of me getting even more promotions by becoming a concubine…
Still, I have some worries.
What will happen to jet engines after my death?
Doing maintenance on them can be entrusted to anyone.
But the one able to create something new is just me.
They are now even being installed on ships, you know?
It scares me how they could end up becoming OOPARTs…
------------------ 
EX9 – A day from Miranda’s lifeSalut! Ça va?
Miranda here.
Today I’m having a rare day off.
The school is not in session, the social season is too, and I don’t have any particular things to do!
In other words, it’s a rare day of doing nothing!
I don’t have plans to meet Teal and do not need to visit the castle.
Viva, no plans for the day!
Thinking, “Hell yeah! I will sleep as much as I want!” I slept enough yesterday and ended up waking up before the maid came to do it for me as usual.
As it’s kinda boring doing nothing while awaiting the maid to come, I picked up the newest book about Sages of the Round Table I had beside my pillow.
Hmm, is it good?
In this new work, the relationship between the sages takes a new step.
As the original author has already died, their followers started writing new books, so, strictly speaking, it’s not an “official” continuation but a kind of spin-off where their mutual support for each other is shown on a more deep level and with respect.
I didn’t think I could be rendered speechless reading BL…
And so, after I wasted enough time, the maid finally came to wake me.
Today, it’s not Lisa.
She does have her days off, you know? I don’t have her following me all year.
Though there’s no doubt that she’s a head maid serving me.
After quickly fixing my appearance, I go to the dining room.
So I’m having breakfast with Mother today?
“Good morning, Mother.”
“Good morning, Miranda. Now, let’s eat breakfast.”
The Mirandiehl family’s breakfast is quite hearty.
For me and my mother, the servants use discretion, but Brother Grande enjoys eating it, what with him being a knight and all.
Don’t you also often want to eat yourself while watching competitive eaters consume their food?
If you try to eat breakfast with that notion, you could die.
So when there’s only me and my mother, I don’t need to be worried about overeating.
“Miranda, you don’t have anything planned for today, right?”
“Yes, I do not. Do you have work at the ARLMCW afterward?”
“That plan went up in smoke… So that’s why I am sorry, but can I borrow the detached house? Even though the meeting was cancelled, Lady Schutted and others expressed their desire to come.”
So the noble ladies will gather in the room full of plushies now?
I get that Lady Schutted was slated to come for the gynecology conference here, but could it be that they cancelled their plans purely due to wanting to see the toys? It couldn’t, right?
“Well… I do not mind, but what should I do? Maybe I will go and read some books at the mansion.”
“I am sorry, Miranda. I appreciate your generosity.”
Recently, that detached house has become a gathering place for noble ladies.
When I am not at the family house, the place sees quite frequent use.
Even if it’s originally a hobby room everyone could go to, isn’t it used too much for social visits?
I feel like this is being ignored since that place is a good one for noble wives of certain ages to return to in their childhood days.
After having a meal, I read for two hours.
Finally, I got some free time to myself.
Having finished the sages’ book, when I wondered what to do, it came to me.
I’m not sure who developed it, but this world has the Othello game.
To be precise, it appeared just recently.
As a handcrafted product for now, it’s a little pricey, but being a playing tool not needing much thought to use, it’s now popular with noble circles.
There seem to be families where spouses, by playing it, have deepened their relationships.
By the way, the best player in our family is Father, and the next is Lisa.
When playing the game with her, I always get trounced quite thoroughly.
Even so, I am still one of the strongest in the family, with 3rd or 4th place overall… But I can’t tell for sure, as I don’t know precisely what Mother’s prowess is.
That’s where I had an idea.
How about we hold an Othello tournament?
Since the maids usually have work, we can only do such a thing at night.
With that said, I want anyone who’s free to issue a formal challenge, and if I win, you can give me some old jewel or something.
So I seek an opponent.
Here I am, in the afternoon, sitting in one corner of the lobby of the mansion with the game prepared, waiting for the challengers.
A first one appeared after a couple minutes of waiting.
From there, a crowd of people appeared, and the number of challengers increased.
Before I knew it, I was standing outside the circle of players.
How it happened, I am not sure. Maids, while I haven’t paid attention, snatched the Othello set from me. It’s not like I was under the effects of some illusion or supernatural power, but with this, I got a taste of what happens when they get excited…
It’s not that I was ignored or anything, just that when A asked B to have a game, I gave up my seat, and then C came, then D, and I couldn’t return to my seat since then.
Still, don’t you have work to do?
I was left with no choice other than to return to my room and take an afternoon nap.
I couldn’t do that at all recently.
Zzz…
When Father and Brother Grande returned home in the evening, we had dinner.
Those two eat an enormous amount of food… When you use magic, it’s easy for one to get hungry, I think, and my brother, who needs to use a lot of mana for work, especially, ends up eating quite a lot.
After dinner, I washed up my body with cleaning magic and went to sleep.
It felt like I really spent the whole day doing nothing, which flew by very fast.
I would have liked to spend it more leisurely, but then Lisa, who was supposed to have a day off, forced her way into the Othello tournament the maids played and trampled over everyone.
When I noticed it, I saw a neatly put-away Othello set and a note beside it.
Lisa, please rest yourself well…
Now, tomorrow is school, so I have to do my best~

In every chapter, Miranda-chan looks cute, and I will be glad if people will like her enough to consider themselves her fans.
But Brother Grande is quite rugged-looking, too…
